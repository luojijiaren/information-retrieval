 '''''Turandot''''' is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini, set to a libretto in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. Though Puccini's first interest in the subject was based on his reading of Friedrich Schiller 's [http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/s#a289 List of Friedrich Schiller's works] adaptation of the play, his work is most nearly based on the earlier text '' Turandot '' by Carlo Gozzi. Turandot was unfinished at the time of Puccini's death and was later completed by Franco Alfano. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 25 April 1926 and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions. The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was conducted by Ettore Panizza. == Origin of the name == Turandot is a Persian word and name meaning "the daughter of Turan ", Turan being a region of Central Asia which used to be part of the Persian Empire. In Persian, the fairy tale is known as ''Turandokht'', with "dokht" being a contraction for ''dokhtar'' (meaning ''daughter''), and both the "kh" and "t" are clearly pronounced. However, according to Puccini scholar Patrick Vincent Casali, the final "t" should not be sounded in the pronunciation of the opera's name or when referring to the title character, as Puccini never pronounced it (according to Rosa Raisa, the first singer to play the title role) and, as Casali notes, the musical setting of many of Calaf's intonations of the name makes sounding the final "t" all but impossible. For a discussion about the pronunciation of the name, ''cf.''  / Online  | url = http://oq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/13/4/77/ }} However Simonetta Puccini, Puccini's granddaughter and keeper of the Villa Puccini and Mausoleum, clearly states that the final "t" must be pronounced. == History == The story of Turandot was taken from the Persian collection of stories called '' The Book of One Thousand and One Days '' [http://www.operapaedia.org/Opera.aspx?article=1169&id;=4015 based on a story by the Persian poet Nizemi] "Turandokht" as a cold Chinese princess was found.

If he fails, he will be beheaded" The moon rises, and the crowd's cries for blood turn into silence. The doomed Prince of Persia is led before the crowd on his way to execution. The young Prince is so handsome that the crowd and the Prince of Tartary are moved to compassion and call on Turandot to spare his life (The crowd, Prince of Tartary: ''O giovinetto!''). She appears, and with a single imperious gesture orders the execution to continue. The Prince of Tartary, who has never seen Turandot before, falls immediately in love. He cries out Turandot's name (three times) with joy, and the Prince of Persia echoes his final cry. The crowd screams in horror as the Prince of Persia is beheaded. "My lord, listen!""" "Death!", and the crowd gasps. Rushing to the gong that hangs in front of the palace, he strikes it three times, declaring himself a suitor. From the palace balcony, Turandot accepts the challenge, as Ping, Pang and Pong laugh at the prince's foolishness. === Act 2 === ''Scene 1: A pavilion in the imperial palace. Before sunrise'' Ping, Pang, and Pong lament their place as ministers, poring over palace documents and presiding over endless rituals. They prepare themselves for either a wedding or a funeral (Ping, Pang, Pong: ''Ola, Pang!''). Ping suddenly longs for his country house in Honan, with its small lake surrounded by bamboo. Pong remembers his grove of forests near Tsiang, and Pang recalls his gardens near Kiu. The three share fond memories of life away from the palace (Ping, Pang, Pong: ''Ho una casa nell'Honan'') but are shaken back to the realities of Turandot's bloody reign. They continually accompany young men to death and recall their ghastly fate. As the palace trumpet sounds, the ministers ready themselves for another spectacle as they await the entrance of the Emperor. ''Scene 2: The courtyard of the palace. Sunrise'' The Emperor Altoum, father of Turandot, sits on his grand throne in his palace. He urges the Prince to withdraw his challenge but the Prince refuses (Altoum, the Prince: ''Un giuramento atroce''). Turandot enters and explains ('' In questa reggia '') that her ancestress of millennia past, Princess Lo-u-Ling, reigned over her kingdom "in silence and joy, resisting the harsh domination of men" until she was ravished and murdered by an invading foreign prince. Lo-u-Ling now lives again in Turandot and out of revenge she has sworn never to let any man possess her. She warns the Prince to withdraw, but again he refuses. The Princess presents her first riddle: ''Straniero, ascolta!'' - ".....What is born each night and dies each dawn?" The Prince correctly replies, "Hope." '' The Princess, unnerved, presents her second riddle (''Guizza al pari di fiamma'' - "What flickers red and warm like a flame, but is not fire?") The Prince thinks for a moment before replying, ''Sangue'' - "Blood". Turandot is shaken. The crowd cheers the Prince, provoking Turandot's anger. She presents her third riddle (''Gelo che ti da foco''- "What is like ice, but burns like fire?"). As the prince thinks, Turandot taunts him. Suddenly he cries out victory and announces, "Turandot!" The crowd cheers for the triumphant Prince. Turandot throws herself at her father's feet and pleads with him not to leave her to the Prince's mercy. The Emperor insists that an oath is sacred, and it is Turandot's duty to wed the Prince (Turandot, Altoum, the Prince: ''Figlio del cielo''). As she cries out in anger, the Prince stops her, saying that he has a proposal for her: ''Tre enigmi m'hai proposto'' - "You do not know my name. Bring me my name before sunrise, and at sunrise, I will die" Turandot accepts. The Emperor declares that he hopes to call the Prince his son come sunrise. === Act 3=== ''Scene 1: The palace gardens. Night'' In the distance, heralds call out Turandot's command: ''Cosi comanda Turandot'' - "This night, none shall sleep in Peking! The penalty for all will be death if the Prince's name is not discovered by morning". The Prince waits for dawn and anticipates his victory: '' Nessun dorma '' - "Nobody shall sleep!... Nobody shall sleep! Even you, O Princess" "Princess, Love!""You who are begirdled by ice""Princess of death") and then takes her in his arms and kisses her in spite of her resistance. Here Puccini's work ends. The remainder of the music was completed by Franco Alfano. [http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=16426 A later attempt at completing the opera was made, with the co-operation of the publishers, Ricordi, in 2002 by Luciano Berio ] The Prince tries to convince Turandot to love him. At first she is disgusted, but after he kisses her, she feels herself turning towards passion. She asks him to ask for nothing more and to leave, taking his mystery with him. The Prince however, reveals his name, "" ''Scene 2: The courtyard of the palace. Dawn'' "It is... love!" The crowd cheers and acclaims the two lovers (''O sole! Vita! Eternita''). == Critical response == Whilst long recognised as the most tonally adventurous of his operas, [http://www.bpmonline.org.uk/bpm4-turandot.html Jonathan Christian Petty and Marshall Tuttle, "Tonal Psychology in Puccini's ''Turandot'' ", Center for Korean Studies, University of California, Berkeley and Langston University, 2001] Turandot has also been considered as at best a flawed masterpiece, and some critics have been unreservedly hostile. Thus Joseph Kerman states: :"Nobody would deny that dramatic potential can be found in this tale. Puccini, however, did not find it; his music does nothing to rationalize the legend or illuminate the characters... Joseph Kerman, ''Opera As Drama'', New York: Knopf, 1956 (revised edition, pp. 205/206. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988, ISBN 0520062744) " and he apparently considered the opera as a whole "depraved". :"Nothing in the text of the final duet suggests that Calaf's love for Turandot amounts to anything more than a physical obsession: nor can the ingenuities of Simoni and Adami's text for 'Del primo pianto' convince us that the Princess's submission is any less hormonal.
