 :''This article refers to the Christian saint. For other uses of the name, see Chrysostomos.'' '''John Chrysostom''' (c. 347&"golden mouthed", rendered in English as Chrysostom. Pope Vigilius, ''Constitution of Pope Vigilius'', 553 The Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches honor him as a saint and count him among the Three Holy Hierarchs, together with Saints Basil the Great and Gregory Nazianzus. He is recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as a saint and Doctor of the Church. Churches of the Western tradition, including the Roman Catholic Church, some Anglican provinces, and parts of the Lutheran Church, commemorate him on September 13. Some Lutheran and many Anglican provinces commemorate him on the traditional Eastern feast day of January 27. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria recognizes John Chrysostom as a saint (feast days: 16 Thout and 17 Hathor ). [http://www.copticcentre.com/synaxarium.pdf Coptic synaxarium] John is known in Christianity chiefly as a preacher, theologian and liturgist, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Among his sermons, eight directed against Judaizing Christians remain controversial for their impact on the development of Christian antisemitism.

The Fathers of the Church; v. 68 (Washington: Catholic University of America Press, 1979) Walter Laqueur, ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times To The Present Day,'' (Oxford University Press: 2006), p. 48.

He was also active in destruction of pagan symbols and places of worship, including the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. ==Biography==  ===Early life and education=== John was born in Antioch in 349. The date of John's birth is disputed. For a discussion see Robert Carter, "The Chronology of St. John Chrysostom's Early Life""La valeur historique du dialogue de Palladius et la chronologie de saint Jean Chrysostome" Different scholars describe his mother Anthusa as a pagan "John Chrysostom", ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' or as a Christian, and his father was a high ranking military officer. The ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' describes Chrysostom's mother as a pagan. In Pauline Allen and Wendy Mayer, ''John Chrysostom'', (Routledge:2000), p.5 ISBN 0-415-18252-2, she is described as a Christian. John's father died soon after his birth and he was raised by his mother. He was baptised in 368 or 373 and tonsure d as a reader (one of the minor orders of the Church). Wilken (p. 7) prefers 368 for the date of Chrysostom's baptism, the ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' prefers the later date of 373. As a result of his mother's influential connections in the city, John began his education under the pagan teacher Libanius. From Libanius John acquired the skills for a career in rhetoric, as well as a love of the Greek language and literature. Wilken, p. 5. As he grew older, however, he became more deeply committed to Christianity and went on to study theology under Diodore of Tarsus, founder of the re-constituted School of Antioch. According to the Christian historian Sozomen, Libanius was supposed to have said on his deathbed that John would have been his successor "if the Christians had not taken him from us".  He lived with extreme asceticism and became a hermit in about 375; he spent the next two years continually standing, scarcely sleeping, and committing the Bible to memory. As a consequence of these practices, his stomach and kidneys were permanently damaged and poor health forced him to return to Antioch. Pauline Allen and Wendy Mayer, ''John Chrysostom'', (Routledge:2000), p.6 ISBN 0-415-18252-2, ===Priesthood and service in Antioch=== He was ordained as a deacon in 381 by Saint Meletius of Antioch, and was ordained as a presbyter (that is, a priest ) in 386 by Bishop Flavian I of Antioch. Over the course of twelve years, he gained popularity because of the eloquence of his public speaking, especially his insightful expositions of Bible passages and moral teaching. The most valuable of his works from this period are his '' Homilies '' on various books of the Bible. He emphasised charitable giving and was concerned with the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor. He also spoke out against abuse of wealth and personal property:  See Cajetan Baluffi, ''The Charity of the Church'', trans. Denis Gargan (Dublin: M H Gill and Son, 1885), p. 39 and Alvin J. Schmidt, ''Under the Influence: How Christianity Transformed Civilization (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 2001), p. 152; cited in Thomas Woods, How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization, (Washington, D.C.: Regenery, 2005), p.174. One incident that happened during his service in Antioch illustrates the influence of his sermons. When Chrysostom arrived in Antioch, the bishop of the city had to intervene with Emperor Theodosius I on behalf of citizens who had gone on a rampage mutilating statues of the Emperor and his family. During the weeks of Lent in 397, John preached twenty-one sermons in which he entreated the people to see the error of their ways. These made a lasting impression on the general population of the city: many pagans converted to Christianity as a result of the sermons. As a result, Theodosius' vengeance was not as severe as it might have been. Robert Wilken, "John Chrysostom" in ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity,'' ed. Everett Ferguson (New York:Garland Publishing, 1997). ===Archbishop of Constantinople=== , New York City]] David H. Farmer, ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints,'' second ed. (New York:Oxford University Press, 1987) p.232. In 401, Chrysostom led a mob to finally destroy the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus John Freely, ''The Western Shores of Turkey: Discovering the Aegean and Mediterranean Coasts'' 2004, p. 148 (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, although it had been destroyed and rebuilt several times by then). His time in Constantinople was more tumultuous than his time in Antioch. Theophilus, the Patriarch of Alexandria, wanted to bring Constantinople under his sway and opposed John's appointment to Constantinople. Being an opponent of Origen 's teachings, he accused John of being too partial to the teachings of that theologian. Theophilus had disciplined four Egypt ian monk s (known as "the tall brothers") over their support of Origen's teachings. They fled to and were welcomed by John. He made another enemy in Aelia Eudoxia, the wife of the eastern Emperor Arcadius, who assumed (perhaps with justification) that his denunciations of extravagance in feminine dress were aimed at herself. Depending on one's outlook, John was either tactless or fearless when denouncing offences in high places. An alliance was soon formed against him by Eudoxia, Theophilus and others of his enemies. They held a synod in 403 (the Synod of the Oak ) to charge John, in which his connection to Origen was used against him. It resulted in his deposition and banishment. He was called back by Arcadius almost immediately, as the people became "tumultuous" over his departure.  There was also an earthquake the night of his arrest, which Eudoxia took for a sign of God 's anger, prompting her to ask Arcadius for John's reinstatement.  Peace was short-lived. A silver statue of Eudoxia was erected in the Augustaion, near his cathedral. John denounced the dedication ceremonies. He spoke against her in harsh terms: "Again Herodias raves; again she is troubled; she dances again; and again desires to receive John's head in a charger," Socrates Scholasticus, op cit [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.ix.xix.html "Chapter XVIII: Of Eudoxia's Silver Statue"], p. 150. an allusion to the events surrounding the death of John the Baptist. Once again he was banished, this time to the Caucasus in Armenia. "John Chrysostom" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Church History,'' ed. Jerald C. Brauer (Philadelphia:Westminster Press, 1971).  Pope Innocent I protested at this banishment, but to no avail. Innocent sent a delegation to intercede on behalf of John in 405. It was led by Gaudentius of Brescia; Gaudentius and his companions, two bishops, encountered many difficulties and never reached their goal of entering Constantinople. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06393c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Gaudentius ] John wrote letters which still held great influence in Constantinople. As a result of this, he was further exiled to Pitiunt (Georgia) where his tomb is the shrine for pilgrims. He never reached this destination, as he died during the journey. His last words are said to have been, "" (Glory be to God for all things). ==Writings== {|style="float: right;" |- | |- | |} ===Homilies===  Known as "the greatest preacher in the early church", John's sermons have been one of his greatest lasting legacies. "John Chrysostom" in ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity''. Chrysostom's extant homiletical works are vast, including many hundreds of exegetical sermons on both the New Testament (especially the works of Saint Paul ) and the Old Testament (particularly on Genesis ). Among his extant exegetical works are sixty-seven homilies on Genesis, fifty-nine on the Psalms, ninety on the Gospel of Matthew, eighty-eight on the Gospel of John, and fifty-five on the Acts of the Apostles. "John Chrysostom" in the Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08452b.htm online], retrieved March 20, 2007. The sermons were written down by the audience and subsequently circulated, revealing a style that tended to be direct and greatly personal, but was also formed by the rhetorical conventions of his time and place. Yohanan (Hans) Lewy, "John Chrysostom" in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' (CD-ROM Edition Version 1.0), Ed. Cecil Roth (Keter Publishing House: 1997). ISBN 965-07-0665-8. In general, his homiletical theology displays much characteristic of the Antiochian school (i.e., somewhat more literal in interpreting Biblical events), but he also uses a good deal of the allegorical interpretation more associated with the Alexandrian school. John's social and religious world was formed by the continuing and pervasive presence of paganism in the life of the city. One of his regular topics was the paganism in the culture of Constantinople, and in his sermons he thunders against popular pagan amusements: the theatre, horseraces, and the revelry surrounding holidays. Wilken, p.30. In particular, he criticized Christians for taking part in such activities:  John's homilies on Paul's Epistles proceed linearly, methodically treating the texts verse by verse, often going into great detail. He shows a concern to be understood by laypeople, sometimes offering colorful analogies and practical examples. At other times, he offers extended comments clearly intended to address the theological subtleties of a heretical misreading, or to demonstrate the presence of a deeper theme. One of the recurring features of John's sermons is his emphasis on care for the needy. Liebeschuetz, J.H.W.G. ''Barbarians and Bishops: Army, Church, and State in the age of Arcadius and Chrysostom'', (Oxford: Clarendon Rress, 1990) pp.175-176 Echoing themes found in the Gospel of Matthew, he calls upon the rich to lay aside materialism in favor of helping the poor, often employing all of his rhetorical skills to shame wealthy people to abandon conspicuous consumption:  ===Treatises=== Outside of his sermons, a number of John's other treatises have had a lasting influence. One such work is John's early treatise ''Against Those Who Oppose the Monastic Life'', written while he was a deacon (sometime before 386), which was directed to parents, pagan as well as Christian, whose sons were contemplating a monastic vocation. The book is a sharp attack on the values of Antiochene upper-class urban society written by someone who was a member of that class. Wilken, p.26. Chrysostom also writes that, already in his day, it was customary for Antiochenes to send their sons to be educated by monks. Thomas Woods, ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization,'' (Washington, D.C.: Regenery, 2005), ISBN 0-89526-038-7, p.44 Other important treatises written by John include '' On the Priesthood '' (one of his earlier works), ''Instructions to Catechumens'', and '' On the Incomprehensibility of the Divine Nature ''. ''On the Priesthood'' was well-known already during Chrysostom's lifetime, and is cited by Jerome in 392 in his '' De Viris Illustribus '', chapter 129 In addition, he wrote a series of letters to the deaconess , of which seventeen are extant.  ===Sermons on Jews and Judaizing Christians===  During his first two years as a presbyter in Antioch (386-387), John denounced Jew s and Judaizing Christians in a series of eight sermons delivered to Christians in his congregation who were taking part in Jewish festivals and other Jewish observances. See Wilken, p.xv, and also "John Chrysostom" in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' It is disputed whether the main target were specifically Judaizers or Jews in general. His homilies were expressed in the conventional manner, utilizing the uncompromising rhetorical form known as the '' psogos '' (Greek: blame). One of the purposes of these homilies was to prevent Christians from participating in Jewish customs, and thus prevent the perceived erosion of Chrysostom's flock. In his sermons, John criticized those "Judaizing Christians", who were participating in Jewish festivals and taking part in other Jewish observances, such as the shabbat, submitted to circumcision and made pilgrimage to Jewish holy places. Wilken, p.xv. John claimed that on the shabbats and Jewish festivals synagogue s were full of Christians, especially women, who loved the solemnity of the Jewish liturgy, enjoyed listening to the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, and applauded famous preachers in accordance with the contemporary custom. "John Chrysostom" in ''Encyclopedia Judaica''. A more recent apologetic theory is that he instead tried to persuade Jewish Christians, who for centuries had kept connections with Jews and Judaism, to choose between Judaism and Christianity. Rodney Stark, ''The Rise of Christianity. How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries,'' (Princeton University Press:1997)p.66-67.  John Chrysostom, ''Discourses Against Judaizing Christians'' (vol. 68 of ''Fathers of the Church''), trans. Paul W. Harkins (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1979) p.x The original Benedictine editor of the homilies, Bernard de Montfaucon, gives the following footnote to the title: "A discourse against the Jews; but it was delivered against those who were Judaizing and keeping the fasts with them [the Jews]." Chrysostom, ''Discourses Against Judaizing Christians'', p.xxxi) ===Liturgy=== Beyond his preaching, the other lasting legacy of John is his influence on Christian liturgy. Two of his writings are particularly notable. He harmonized the liturgical life of the Church by revising the prayers and rubrics of the Divine Liturgy, or celebration of the Holy Eucharist. To this day, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite typically celebrate the  as the normal eucharistic liturgy, although his exact connection with it remains a matter of debate among experts. Parry (2001), pp. 268-269 These same churches also read his Catechetical Homily (''Hieratikon'') at every Easter, the greatest feast of the church year.  ==Legacy and influence== During a time when city clergy were subject to criticism for their high lifestyle, John was determined to reform his clergy in Constantinople. These efforts were met with resistance and limited success. He was an excellent preacher Parry (2001), pp. 268-269 whose sermons and writings are still studied and quoted. As a theologian, he has been and continues to be very important in Eastern Christianity, and is generally considered the most prominent doctor of the Greek Church, but has been less important to Western Christianity. His writings have survived to the present day more so than any of the other Greek Fathers. "St John Chrysostom" in the Catholic Encyclopedia, available [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08452b.htm online]; retrieved March 20, 2007. He rejected the contemporary trend for allegory, instead speaking plainly and applying Bible passages and lessons to everyday life. His exile demonstrated the rivalry between Constantinople and Alexandria for recognition as the preeminent Eastern See, while in the west, the Pope 's primacy remained unquestioned. ===Influence on the Catechism of the Catholic Church and clergy=== John's influence on church teachings is interwoven throughout the current Catechism of the Catholic Church (revised 1992). The Catechism cites him in eighteen sections, particularly his reflections on the purpose of prayer and the meaning of the Lord's Prayer :  Christian clerics, such as R.S. Storr, refer to him as "one of the most eloquent preachers who ever since apostolic times have brought to men the divine tidings of truth and love", and the 19th-century John Henry Cardinal Newman described John as a "bright, cheerful, gentle soul; a sensitive heart." John Henry Newman, "St. Chrysostom" in ''The Newman Reader'' (Rambler:1859) available [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/historical/volume2/saints/chrysostom/chapter2.html online](see esp. chapter 2). Retrieved March 20, 2007 ===Music and literature=== John's liturgical legacy has inspired several musical compositions. Particularly noteworthy are Sergei Rachmaninoff 's '''', Op.31, composed in 1910,   James Joyce 's novel '' Ulysses '' includes a character named Mulligan who brings 'Chrysostomos' into another character's mind because Mulligan's gold-stopped teeth and his gift of the gab earn him the title which St. John Chrysostom's preaching earned him, 'golden-mouthed': Blaimes (1996, 3). Chrysostomos also refers to Stephen, the independent and exiled genius: ''"He peered sideways up and gave a long low whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos."'' Joyce (1961, 3). ===Relics=== John Chrysostom died in the city of Comana in the year 407 on his way to his place of exile. There his relic s remained until 438 when, thirty years after his death, they were transferred to Constantinople during the reign of the Empress Eudoxia 's son, the Emperor Theodosius II (408-450), under the guidance of John's disciple, , who by that time had become Archbishop of Constantinople (434-447). John's relics were looted from Constantinople by Crusaders in 1204 and taken to Rome, but were returned to the Orthodox on November 27, 2004 by Pope John Paul II.  His silver and jewel-encrusted skull is now kept in the Vatopedi  Monastery on Mount Athos in northern Greece, and is credited by Christians with miraculous healings. His [http://www.orthodoxphotos.com/cgi-bin/photo.pl?path=Holy_Relics/Various&file;=18.jpg right hand] is preserved on Mount Athos, and numerous smaller relics are scattered throughout the world.  ==Notes==  ==References==   * Allen, Pauline and Mayer, Wendy (2000).
