Ichthyosaurs thrived during much of the Mesozoic era; based on fossil evidence, they first appeared approximately 245 million years ago ( mya ) and disappeared about 90 million years ago, about 25 million years before the dinosaur s became extinct. During the middle Triassic , ichthyosaurs evolved from as-yet unidentified land reptiles that moved back into the water, in a development parallel to that of the ancestors of modern-day dolphin s and whale s. They were particularly abundant in the Jurassic Period, until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by plesiosaur s in the Cretaceous Period. They belong to the order known as '''Ichthyosauria''' or '''Ichthyopterygia''' ('fish flippers' - a designation introduced by Sir Richard Owen in 1840, although the term is now used more for the parent clade of the Ichthyosauria). ==Description==  Ichthyosaurs averaged two to four metres in length (although a few were smaller, and some species grew much larger), with a porpoise -like head and a long, toothed snout. Built for speed, like modern tuna, some ichthyosaurs appear also to have been deep divers, like some modern whales (Motani, 2000). It has been estimated that ichthyosaurs could swim at speeds up to 40 km/h (25 mph). [http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/42/beeldende-kunst/] Similar to modern cetacea ns such as whales and dolphins, they were air-breathing and also were viviparous (some adult fossils have even been found containing es). Although they were reptiles and descended from egg-laying ancestors, viviparity is not as unexpected as it first appears. All air-breathing marine creatures must either come ashore to lay eggs, like turtle s and some sea snake s, or else give birth to live young in surface waters, like whales and dolphins. Given their streamlined bodies, heavily adapted for fast swimming, it would have been difficult for ichthyosaurs to scramble successfully onto land to lay eggs. According to weight estimates by Ryosuke Motani [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/motani/ichthyo/weight.html] a 2.4 meter (8 ft) '' Stenopterygius '' weighed around 163 to 168 kg (360 to 370 lb), whilst a 4.0 meter (13 ft) '' Ophthalmosaurus icenicus '' weighed 930 to 950 kg (about a ton). Although ichthyosaurs looked like fish, they were not. Biologist Stephen Jay Gould said the ichthyosaur was his favorite example of convergent evolution, where similarities of structure are analogous not homologous, for this group: converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a dorsal fin and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design. These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing - the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor.   Ichthyosaurs had fin-like limbs, which were possibly used for stabilisation and directional control, rather than propulsion, which would have come from the large shark-like tail. The tail was bi-lobed, with the lower lobe being supported by the caudal vertebral column, which was "kinked" ventrally to follow the contours of the ventral lobe. Apart from the obvious similarities to fish, the ichthyosaurs also shared parallel developmental features with dolphin s, lamnid sharks, and tunas. This gave them a broadly similar appearance, possibly implied similar activity levels (including thermoregulation), and presumably placed them broadly in a similar ecological niche.  For their food, many of the fish-shaped ichthyosaurs relied heavily on ancient cephalopod kin of squid s called belemnite s. Some early ichthyosaurs had teeth adapted for crushing shellfish. They also most likely fed on fish, and a few of the larger species had heavy jaws and teeth that indicated they fed on smaller reptiles. Ichthyosaurs ranged so widely in size, and survived for so long, that they are likely to have had a wide range of prey. Typical ichthyosaurs have very large eyes, protected within a bony ring, suggesting that they may have hunted at night. ==History of discoveries== The genus had first been described in 1699 from fossil fragments discovered in Wales. The first fossil  vertebra e were published twice in 1708 as tangible mementos of the Universal Deluge. The first complete ichthyosaur fossil was found in 1811 by Mary Anning in Lyme Regis, along what is now called the Jurassic Coast. She subsequently discovered three separate species. ft (17 m) of this extinct marine reptile. In 1992, Canadian ichthyologist Dr. Elizabeth Nicholls (Curator of Marine Reptiles at the Royal Tyrrell Museum) uncovered the largest fossil specimen ever, a 23 m (75 ft)long example. == Evolutionary history ==  The earliest ichthyosaurs, looking more like finned lizards than the familiar fish or dolphin forms, are known from the Early and Early-Middle ( Olenekian and Anisian ) Triassic strata of Canada, China, Japan, and Spitsbergen in Norway. These primitive forms included the genera '' Chaohusaurus '', '' Grippia '', and '' Utatsusaurus ''. These very early proto-ichthyosaurs, which are now classified as Ichthyopterygia rather than as ichthyosaurs proper (Motani 1997, Motani et al. 1998), quickly gave rise to true ichthyosaurs sometime around the boundary between the Early Triassic and Middle Triassic. These later diversified into a variety of forms, including the sea serpent like '' Cymbospondylus '', which reached 10 meters, and smaller more typical forms like '' Mixosaurus ''. By the Late Triassic, ichthyosaurs consisted of both classic Shastasauria and more advanced, "dolphin"-like Euichthyosauria ('' Californosaurus '', ''Toretocnemus'') and Parvipelvia (''Hudsonelpidia'', ''Macgowania''). Experts disagree over whether these represent an evolutionary continuum, with the less specialised shastosaurs a paraphyletic grade that was evolving into the more advanced forms (Maisch and Matzke 2000), or whether the two were separate clade s that evolved from a common ancestor earlier on (Nicholls and Manabe 2001).  During the Carnian and Norian, shastosaurs reached huge sizes. '' Shonisaurus popularis '', known from a number of specimens from the Carnian of Nevada, was 15 meters long. Norian shonisaurs are known from both sides of the Pacific. ''Himalayasaurus tibetensis'' and ''Tibetosaurus'' (probably a synonym) have been found in Tibet. These large (10 to 15 meters long) ichthyosaurs probably belong to the same genus as ''Shonisaurus'' (Motani ''et al.'', 1999; Lucas, 2001, pp.& These giants (along with their smaller cousins) seemed to have disappeared at the end of the Norian. Rhaetian (latest Triassic) ichthyosaurs are known from England, and these are very similar to those of the Early Jurassic. Like the dinosaurs, the ichthyosaurs and their contemporaries the plesiosaurs survived the end-Triassic extinction event, and immediately diversified to fill the vacant ecological niches of the earliest Jurassic.  The Early Jurassic, like the Late Triassic, was the heyday of the ichthyosaurs, which are represented by four families and a variety of species, ranging from one to ten meters in length. Genera include '' Eurhinosaurus '', '' Ichthyosaurus '', '' Leptonectes '', '' Stenopterygius '', and the large predator '' Temnodontosaurus '', along with the persistently primitive ''Suevoleviathan'', which was little changed from its Norian ancestors. All these animals were streamlined, dolphin-like forms, although the more primitive animals were perhaps more elongated than the advanced and compact '' Stenopterygius '' and '' Ichthyosaurus ''.  Ichthyosaurs were still common in the Middle Jurassic, but had now decreased in diversity. All belonged to the single clade Ophthalmosauria. Represented by the 4 meter long '' Ophthalmosaurus '' and related genera, they were very similar to ''Ichthyosaurus'', and had attained a perfect "tear-drop" streamlined form. The eyes of ''Ophthalmosaurus'' were huge, and it is likely that these animals hunted in dim and deep water (Motani 2000). Ichthyosaurs seemed to decrease in diversity even further with the Cretaceous. Only three genera are known, '' Caypullisaurus '', ''Maiaspondylus'', and '' Platypterygius '', although they had a worldwide distribution. This last ichthyosaur genus became extinct during the  extinction event early in the Late Cretaceous (as did the pliosaur s). Interestingly, less hydrodynamically efficient animals like mosasaur s and long-necked plesiosaur s flourished. It could be that the ichthyosaurian over-specialisation was a contributing factor to their extinction, possibly being unable to 'keep up' with the fast swimming and highly evasive new teleost fish, which had become dominant at this time, against which the sit-and-wait ambush strategies of the mosasaurs proved superior (Lingham-Soliar 1999). ==Taxonomy of species== * Superorder Ichthyopterygia ** Family '''Grippidae''' *** '' Chaohusaurus '' *** '' Grippia '' ** Family '''Utatsusauridae''' *** '' Utatsusaurus '' ** '''Order ICHTHYOSAURIA''' ** '' Cymbospondylus '' ** Family '''Mixosauridae''' *** '' Mixosaurus '' ** Suborder '''Merriamosauriformes''' *** ''Guanlingsaurus'' ** (unranked) '''Merriamosauria''' ** '''Infraorder Shastasaur ia''' *** Family Shastasaur idae **** '' Shastasaurus '' **** '' Shonisaurus '' **** '' Himalayasaurus '' **** '' Tibetosaurus '' ** '''Infraorder Ichthyosauria''' (=Euichthyosauruia) *** Family ''' Ichthyosauridae ''' **** '' Ichthyosaurus '' *** Family ''' Leptopterygiidae ''' **** '' Leptonectes '' **** '' Eurhinosaurus '' **** '' Excalibosaurus '' *** Family ''' Temnodontosauridae ''' **** '' Temnodontosaurus '' *** Family ''' Ophthalmosauridae ''' **** '' Aegirosaurus '' **** '' Brachypterygius '' **** '' Caypullisaurus '' **** '' Nannopterygius '' **** '' Ophthalmosaurus '' **** '' Platypterygius '' *** Family ''' Stenopterygiidae ''' **** '' Stenopterygius '' ****?''
