 In botanical nomenclature, a hybrid may be given a '''hybrid name''', which is a special kind of botanical name. The '' ICBN '' provides the following options in dealing with a hybrid: * A hybrid may get a normal botanical name; this will usually be the option of choice for naturally occurring hybrids. * A hybrid may also be indicated by a formula listing the parents. Such a formula uses the multiplication sign "" to link the parents. * A hybrid name is usually reserved for horticulturally arising hybrids and . A hybrid name is indicated by a multiplication sign "" placed before the name or epithet, as the case may be. The multiplication sign should be put before the name in case of intergeneric hybrid and otherwise before the relevant epithet. Only when a multiplication sign is not available (e.g., on some typewriters), a small letter "x" may be used as a replacement. Examples : "interspecific hybrid" (a hybrid between two species in the same genus ): the multiplication sign goes before the epithet. "intergeneric hybrid" (a hybrid between two different genera): the multiplication sign is placed before the generic name. This generic name is a so-named "nothogeneric name" Note that the name for a graft-chimaera uses an addition sign "+". The provisions in the '' ICBN '' that deal with hybrid names are [http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0069AppendixINoHa001.htm Art H.1] to H.12. ==External links== "Vienna Code"] (2006) * [http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HORT234/Nomenclature.html The Language of Horticulture]
