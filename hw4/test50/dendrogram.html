A '''dendrogram''' (from Greek ''dendron'' "tree", ''-gramma'' "drawing") is a tree diagram frequently used to illustrate the arrangement of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering. Dendrograms are often used in computational biology to illustrate the clustering of gene s. For a clustering example, suppose this data is to be clustered using Euclidean distance as the distance metric.  The hierarchical clustering dendrogram would be as such:  Here the top row of nodes represent data, and the remaining nodes represent the clusters to which the data belong, and the arrows represent the distance. ==See also== * cladogram * hierarchical clustering
