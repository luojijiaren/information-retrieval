  Grove Music Online recommends that use of the word ''fipple'' should be abandoned because its meaning is confused. However, other sources (eg the Oxford Dictionary of Music) continue to use it. It is distinguished from other members of the family by having holes for seven fingers (the lower one or two often doubled to facilitate the production of semitones ) and one for the thumb of the uppermost hand. The bore of the recorder is tapered slightly, being widest at the mouthpiece end and narrowest at the top on Baroque recorders, or flared almost like a trumpet at the bottom on Renaissance instruments. The recorder was popular in medieval times through the baroque era, but declined in the 18th century in favour of orchestral woodwind instruments, such as the flute, oboe, and clarinet. During its heyday, the recorder was traditionally associated with birds, shepherds, miraculous events, funerals, marriages and amorous scenes. Images of recorders can be found in literature and artwork associated with all these. Purcell, Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi used the recorder to suggest shepherds and birds in their music, a theme that continued in 20th century music.  The recorder was revived in the 20th century, partly in the pursuit of historically informed performance of early music, but also because of its suitability as a simple instrument for teaching music and its appeal to amateur players. Today, it is often thought of as a child's instrument, but there are many professional players who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range. "achieved worldwide recognition as a recorder virtuoso" in her book ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. ISBN 0-521-36681-X. p.62 The sound of the recorder is remarkably clear and sweet, partly because of the lack of upper harmonics and predominance of odd harmonics in the sound. Jean Marc Bonard, "The Physicist's Guide to the Orchestra", 2001, ''Eur. J. Phys.'' 22 89-101  ==The name of the instrument== The instrument has been known by its modern name at least since the 14th century. Grove's Dictionary reports that the earliest use of the word 'recorder' was in the household of the Earl of Derby (later to become King Henry IV) in 1388: ''fistula nomine Recordour''. ''Grove's Dictionary of Music''(online Edition): 'Recorder' article, part 1: 'Nomenclature' The name originates from the use of the word ''record'', one meaning of which is "to practise a piece of music". E. Partridge: ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English'', New York, 1958 Up to the 18th century, the instrument was called '''' (flute) in Italian, the language used in writing music, whereas the instrument we today call the flute was called ''. This has led to some pieces of music occasionally being mistakenly performed on the Flauto traverso (transverse flute) rather than on recorder. ==How the instrument is played==  The recorder is held outwards from the player's lips (rather than to the side, like the "transverse" flute). The player's breath is compressed into a linear airstream by a channel cut into the wooden "block" or fipple (A), in the mouthpiece of the instrument, so as to travel along this channeled duct (B) called the "windway".  Exiting from the windway, the breath is directed against a hard edge (C), called the "labium" or "ramp", which causes the column of air within the resonator tube to oscillate at the desired frequency, determined by the bore length or open tone hole used. The length of the air column (and the pitch of the note produced) is modified by finger holes in the front and thumb hole at the back of the instrument. ==Types of recorders== {| style="border:1px solid #aaa; font-size:95%; background-color:#f9f9f9; padding:10px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="1" class="hintergrundfarbe1 rahmenfarbe1" align=right float | bgcolor="#F8EABA" align="center" colspan="4" | '''RECORDER FAMILY''' |-! bgcolor="#B2C6FF" align="center"|Instruments in C!! bgcolor="#B2C6FF" align="center"|Range! bgcolor="#B2C6FF" align="center"|Instruments in F!! bgcolor="#B2C6FF" align="center"|Range |-align="right" | garklein ||  || sopranino  ||  |-align="right" | soprano (descant)  ||  || alto (treble) ||  |-align="right" | tenor ||  || bass (bass in F)||  |-align="right" | great bass (bass in C) ||  || contra bass ||  |-align="right" | subcontra bass ||  || sub-subcontrabass (octocontrabass) ||  |} Recorders are made in a variety of sizes. They are most often tuned in C or F, meaning that their lowest note possible is a C or an F. However, instruments in D, B flat, G, and E flat were not uncommon historically and are still found today, especially the tenor recorder in D, which is called a "voice-flute." Edgar Hunt, "Fitting the Instrument to the Music"; ''Recorder and Music'' 7, no. 9, March 1983: pp227-228 Refer to the table to see the entire recorder family in C and F. The recorder most often used for solo music is the treble recorder (known as alto in the USA), and when the recorder is specified without further qualification, it is this size that is meant. Anthony Baines: ''Woodwind Instruments and their History'', Music Sales Ltd, 1991, ISBN 9780486268859, p.74: "The ''classic'' recorder is the treble. 'Flutes' and 'Flauti', in the works of Bach, Handel and their contemporaries, do not mean just 'recorders'; they mean 'treble recorders'" The descant (known as the soprano in the USA) also has an important repertoire of solo music (not just school music) and there is a little for tenor and bass recorders. Andrew Mayes: "Carl Dolmetsch and the Recorder Repertoire of the 20th Century", Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2003, ISBN 0754609685: p.241: "Prompted by the scarcity of solo music for bass recorder, Carl Dolmetsch has written this lively gavotte..."; p.248: "There appears to be so small a repertoire for tenor recorder that I decided to write this 'plaint'." Classroom instructors most commonly use the descant. The largest recorders, larger than the bass recorder, are less often used, since they are expensive and their sizes (the contrabass in F is about 2 meters tall) make them hard to handle. An experimental 'piccolino' has also been produced which plays a fourth above the garklein. Although it might be considered that the garklein is already too small for adult-sized fingers to play easily and that the even smaller piccolino was simply not practical, the fact that the holes for each finger are side by side and not in a linear sequence make it quite possible to play. [http://www.hants.gov.uk/hrs/range/range.html Hampshire Recorder Sinfonia guide to the recorder family] For recorder ensemble playing, the descant/soprano, treble/alto, tenor and bass are most common - many players can play all four sizes. Great basses and contrabasses are always welcome but are more expensive. The sopranino does not blend as well and is used primarily in recorder orchestras and for concerto playing. The larger recorders have great enough distances between the finger holes that most people's hands can not reach them all. So, instruments larger than the tenor have keys to enable the player to cover the holes or to provide better tonal response; this is also true of the tenor itself, over the last hole, and much more rarely the alto. In addition, the largest recorders are so long that the player cannot simultaneously reach the finger holes with the hands and reach the mouthpiece with the lips. So, instruments larger than the bass (and some bass recorders too) may use a bocal or crook, a thin metal tube, to conduct the player's breath to the windway, or they may be constructed in sections that fold the recorder into a shape that brings the windway back into place. Today, high-quality recorders are made from a range of hardwoods: maple, pear wood, rosewood, grenadilla, or boxwood with a block of red cedar wood. Trevor Robinson, ''The Amateur Wind Instrument Maker'', University of Massachusetts Press, 1981. ISBN 0-87023-312-2. See chapter 2, "Wooden instruments, materials and methods" Plastic recorders are produced in large quantities. Plastics are cheaper and require less maintenance and quality plastic recorders are equal to or better than lower-end wooden instruments. Beginners' instruments, the sort usually found in children's ensembles, are plastic and can be purchased quite cheaply. Most modern recorders are based on instruments from the Baroque period, although some specialist makers produce replicas of the earlier Renaissance style of instrument. These latter instruments have a wider, less tapered bore and typically possess a less reedy, more blending tone more suited to consort playing. A Rowland-Jones, ''Recorder Technique'' ISBN 0-907908-75-6 and consequently they can play only a single diatonic scale [http://www.recorder-fingerings.com/en/index.php Recorder fingerings ] German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as the recorder began to be treated more seriously and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated. Edgar Hunt, ''The Recorder And Its Music'' Many recorder makers continue to produce German fingered instruments today. Some newer designs of recorder are now being produced. Larger recorders built like organ pipes with square cross sections are cheaper than the normal designs if, perhaps, not so elegant. [http://www.dolmetsch.com/millennium.htm Dolmetsch "Millennium" square section recorders] ===Standard pitch=== Recorders are most commonly pitched at A=440Hz. However, among serious amateurs and professionals, two other standard pitches are commonly found. For baroque instruments, A=415Hz is the ''de facto'' standard, Anthony Rowland-Jones: ''Playing Recorder Sonatas: Interpretation and technique'', Oxford University Press, 1992, ISBN 0198790015, 9780198790013. p.20: "Today's makers of 'Baroque' instruments mostly seem content to compromise at a'=415" while renaissance instruments are often pitched at A=466Hz. John Mansfield Thomson, Anthony Rowland-Jones (editors): ''The Cambridge Companion to the Recorder'', Cambridge University Press, 1995; ISBN 0521358167. p.178: "renaissance recorders [...] are typically built at high pitch (a'=466...)" Both tunings are a compromise between historical accuracy and practicality. For instance, the Stanesby Sr alto, copied by many contemporary makers is based on A=403Hz; some makers indeed offer an instrument at that pitch. Jacqueline Sorel, Baroque Alto Recorder after Stanesby, Sr http://www.sorel-recorders.nl/models/m05stanesbyE.html Some recorder makers offer 3-piece instruments with two middle sections, accommodating two tuning systems. Jacqueline Sorel: Renaissance Recorders after Ganassi: http://www.sorel-recorders.nl/models/m01ganassiE.html The 415 pitch has the advantage that it is an exact semitone lower than 440Hz; there are harpsichords that can shift their keyboard in a matter of minutes. David Jacques Way: Harpsichord Pitch and Transposition http://zhi.net/technical/pitch.shtml The A=392Hz pitch, is similarly another semitone lower. ==Sheet music notation==  Sheet music for recorder is nearly always notated in 'concert key,' meaning that a written "C" in the score actually sounds as a "C." This implies that the player must learn two different sets of similar fingerings, one for the C recorders and another for the F recorders. However, many sizes of recorder do transpose at the octave. The garklein sounds two octaves above the written pitch; the sopranino and soprano sound one octave above written pitch. Alto and tenor sizes do not transpose at all, while the bass and great bass sound one octave above written (bass clef) pitch. Contrabass and subcontrabass are non-transposing while the octocontrabass sounds one octave below written pitch. Sizes from garklein down through tenor are notated in the treble clef while the bass size and lower usually read the bass clef. Professionals can usually read C-clefs and often perform from original notation. Alternative notations which are only occasionally used: # Bass recorder in F may be written in treble clef at real pitch, so that the low F is written a fifth below middle C with three ledger lines. # Bass recorder in F may be written in treble clef an octave above real pitch (i.e. sound an octave below written pitch), so that its fingerings are completely octave-identical to the alto in F. # Tenor recorder in C may be written in bass clef one octave below real pitch in order to read choral parts for tenor voice. # Alto recorder in F may be written down an octave to read alto vocal parts. # All recorders may be transposed by both octave and key so that the lowest note is always written as middle C below the treble clef. In this system, only the tenor is non-transposing while all other parts would transpose up or down in fourths, fifths and octaves as appropriate. # Urtext editions of baroque music may preserve the baroque practice of writing treble(alto) recorder parts in the Violin clef (G clef on the bottom line of the stave). From the player's point of view, this is equivalent to using bass(et) recorder fingerings on the treble(alto) recorder. As a rule of thumb, recorders sound one octave above the human voice after which they are named (soprano recorder is an octave above soprano voice, alto an octave above alto voice, etc.) The recorder's mellow tone and limited harmonics allows for the seemingly deeper sound.

Note 2: Individual recorders may need this hole to be closed (X), half closed(/), or open (O) to play the note in tune. Note 3: See the section  concerning recorders tuned in C or in F. {|border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" align="right" float |+'''How the fingers and holes are numbered'''! style="background:#efefef;" |'''The fingers'''! style="background:#efefef;" |'''The holes''' |- |   |  |} The range of a modern recorder is usually taken to be about two octave s except in virtuoso pieces. See the table above for fingerings of notes in the nominal recorder range of 2 octaves and 1 whole tone. Notes above this range are more difficult to play, and the exact fingerings vary from instrument to instrument, so it is impractical to put them into the table here. Kenneth Wollitz, ''The Recorder Book'', Knopf, 1984. ISBN 0-394-47973-4. See Chapter 1, "Technique" The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder, according to the pictures. In the table, "X" signifies a closed hole, "O" signifies an open hole, and "/" signifies a half-closed hole. The note two octaves and one semitone above the lowest note (C# for soprano, tenor and great bass instruments; F# for sopranino, alto and bass instruments) is difficult to play on most recorders. These notes are best played by covering the end of the instrument (the "bell" "half-holing." Most modern instruments are constructed with double holes or keys to facilitate the playing of these notes; such double holes are occasionally found on baroque instruments, where even the hole for the third finger of the left hand can be doubled. Other chromatic scale degrees are played by so-called "fork" fingerings, uncovering one hole and covering one or more of the ones below it. Fork fingerings have a different tonal character from the diatonic notes, giving the recorder a somewhat uneven sound. Budget tenor/bass recorders might have a single key for low C/F but not low C#/F#, making this note virtually impossible to play. Double low keys allowing both C/F and C#/F# are more or less standard today. Most of the notes in the second octave and above are produced by partially closing the thumbhole on the back of the recorder, a technique known as "pinching". The placement of the thumb is crucial to the intonation and stability of these notes, and varies as the notes increase in pitch, making the boring of a double hole for the thumb unviable. To play the notes in the second octave, the player must tongue somewhat harder in order to excite the second and third harmonics of the instrument. A skilled player can, with a good recorder, play chromatically over two octaves and a fifth. Use of notes in the 3rd octave is becoming more common in modern compositions; several of these notes require closure of the bell or shading of the window area [http://www.dolmetsch.com/efingeringchart.pdf Recorder fingering charts] (ie holding the palm of the hand above the window, partially restricting the air emerging from it). In the hands of a competent player, these upper notes are not especially loud or shrill. The renaissance recorder had a range of two octaves and a sixth Ganassi, ''Opera intitula Fontegara'', available in many modern facsimile editions, though writers on woodwind instruments in general from that period, e.g. Praetorius, often give shorter ranges. This might reflect a distinction between skilled and unskilled players in the renaissance or the differences in instruments made in one region versus another or over time. Modern reproductions of renaissance instruments, especially those from middle of the last century, often have a range as little as one and a half octaves [http://www.recorder-fingerings.com Recorder fingerings ] but more recent makers now produce reproduction renaissance instruments with the full range and Ganassi's fingerings. Consequently many publishers of recorder music refer to 'music for Ganassi recorder', or a similar phrase, when they mean recorder music with a range greater than two octaves and a tone. Changes in dynamics are not easy to achieve on the recorder if the player is accustomed to other wind instruments. If the player blows harder to play louder, or more softly to play softer, the pitch changes and the note goes out of tune, and unlike the transverse flute, the player cannot change the position of the mouth in relation to the labium in order to compensate. Consequently pitch is controlled largely by the breath, and dynamics are controlled largely by the fingers; for example by resting the fingers lightly on the holes breath leaks around them, lifting the pitch; and the resulting instinctive change in breath pressure to bring the pitch back also drops the volume. Advanced players use alternative fingerings to enable changes in dynamics. Walter van Hauwe, ''The Modern Recorder Player'', Volume III, Schott, 1992. ISBN 0-946535-19-1. See Chapter 3, "Alternative Fingerings". The recorder is notable for its sensitivity to articulation; in addition to its obvious use for artistic effect skilled players can also use this sensitivity to suggest changes in volume. A Rowland-Jones, ''Playing Recorder Sonatas'' Clarendon Press ISBN 0-19-879001-5 ==History== ===Early recorders=== Internal duct-flutes have a long history: an example of an Iron Age specimen, made from a sheep bone, exists in Leeds City Museum. ''Oxford Companion to Music''. See section 1 of "Recorder Family" article  [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/ Recorder Home Page, by Nicholas S. Lander], includes a comprehensive survey of surviving medieval recorders, as well as a consideration of etymological, literary and iconographic evidence. ===The Renaissance=== The recorder achieved great popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries. This development was linked to the fact that art music (as opposed to folk music ) was no longer the exclusive domain of nobility and clergy. The advent of the printing press made it available to the more affluent commoners as well. The popularity of the instrument also reached the courts however. For example, at Henry VIII 's death in 1547, an inventory of his possessions included 76 recorders. ''Oxford Companion to Music''. see section 2 of the article on "Recorder Family" There are also numerous references to the instrument in contemporary literature (eg Shakespeare ''Hamlet, Act III scene ii'', Hamlet: "Ah, ha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!" and Milton ''Paradise Lost, Book I'': "Anon they move/ in perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood/ flutes and soft recorders" ). For an extensive database of literary references to the recorder see [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/quotes.html here] During the Renaissance musical instruments were principally used in dance music and as accompaniment for voices. There are many vocal works with non-texted lines, which possibly were written for instruments. In addition, some vocal music was easily playable with instruments, chanson s, for example. Nevertheless, composers also produced more and more works exclusively for instruments, often based on dance music. (e.g. the ''Lachrimae Pavans'' by John Dowland ). Often they did not specify the instruments to use although some, such as Anthony Holborne, indicated that their music was suitable for the recorder. Anthony Holborne, ''Pavans, Galliards, Almains and other short Aeirs, both grave and light, in five parts, for Viols, Violins, recorders or other Musicall Winde Instruments'', published in 1599 However, even when the composer specified, for instance, viols, the music could successfully be played on recorders. A taste for ensembles of like instruments developed in this era, and so arose " consorts " (groups of musicians playing the same type of instrument) and the families of instruments of various sizes. The diversity of sizes in an instrument family allowed the consort to play music with a very large pitch range. Some of the well known Renaissance composers who wrote instrumental music, or whose vocal music plays well on recorders, were: Kenneth Wollitz, ''The Recorder Book'', Knopf, 1984. ISBN 0-394-47973-4. See Chapter 8, "Repertory of the Recorder" by Colin C. Sterne.  * Guillaume Dufay * Johannes Ockeghem * Josquin des Prez * Heinrich Isaac * Ludwig Senfl * Orlando di Lasso * William Byrd * John Dowland * Anthony Holborne  Polyphony was the dominant music style of the Renaissance, but composers also began to write chordal pieces. The Medieval custom of juxtaposing 2 or 3 different melodies coexisted with "imitative polyphony". Imitative polyphony uses only one melodic line, but breaks it in pieces and divides it among the different parts. One part plays the melody, then the other parts play it in their turns. The music of this epoch was characterized by complex improvised ornamentation. ''The Cambridge Companion to the Recorder'', p.15: "By far the largest amount of space in [Ganassi's treatise published in 1535] is devoted to details about ornamentation, which suggest a high level of extravagant embellishment in a remarkably rhythmically free manner..." Many instruments survive from this period, including an incomplete set of recorders in Nuremberg which date from the 16th century and are still partially playable. Similar to the Medieval recorders, and unlike the Baroque style recorders typically used today, Renaissance recorders have a wide, more or less cylindrical bore. They have powerful low notes (much more so than the Baroque recorders). The wide bore means that a greater quantity of air is required to play the instrument, but this makes them more responsive. Trevor Robinson, ''The Amateur Wind Instrument Maker'', University of Massachusetts Press, 1981. ISBN 0-87023-312-2. See chapter 4, which includes a description of the construction and sound of Renaissance recorders. Many reproduction instruments, especially from the middle of the last century, can only be played reliably over a range of an octave and a sixth; but more and more makers are producing recorders capable of the full range that Ganassi reports, and with his fingerings in tune throughout. When modern music is written for 'Ganassi recorders' it is this type of recorder which is intended. Historically there was, in truth, no such thing as the 'Ganassi' recorder as a distinct type; it was simply the ordinary Renaissance recorder played by a good player who understood the instrument. Adrian Brown, ''The The Ganassi recorder: separating fact from fiction.'', American Recorder 47(5): 11-18, 1984. ===Baroque recorders=== Several changes in the construction of recorders took place in the seventeenth century, resulting in the type of instrument generally referred to as ''Baroque'' recorders, as opposed to the earlier ''Renaissance'' recorders. These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone which was regarded as "sweeter" than that of the earlier instruments, Jonathan Wainwright and Peter Holman, ''From Renaissance To Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2005. ISBN 0-7546-0403-9 at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes, and a slightly reduced range. Eleanor Selfridge-Field, ''Vivaldi's esoteric instruments,'' Early Music '''6''' (1978), 332-339. (RV443 and RV444 have a compass c' - f ''', while perplexingly RV445 has lowest note e.) ===The decline of the recorder=== The instrument went into decline after the 18th century, being used for about the last time as an otherworldly sound by Gluck in his opera '' Orfeo ed Euridice.'' Many reasons have been put forward for this decline. For example the main instrumental innovators of the time (such as the Hotteterre family) chose to concentrate their technological improvements on the flute, rather than the recorder. Eve E. O'Kelly, ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. ISBN 0-521-36681-X. p.31 Also, the fixed relationship of the windway to the labium limits the range of dynamics and expression of the recorder, when compared with the transverse flute. Donald Murray et al. ''Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music'', Oxford University Press, 2004. ISBN 0198165048. p.122 Other possible reasons include an apparent lack of sufficient professional players; a lack of appreciation of the true nature of the recorder by composers; the high pitch of the instrument; the problems (for makers and players) of utilising the full chromatic range; and a perceived "bad reputation" of the instrument based on all these factors. Waitzman, Daniel: ''The Decline of the Recorder in the 18th Century''. Published in ''American Recorder'' 8 no. 2 (Spring 1967). pp.47-51 By the Romantic era, the recorder had been almost entirely superseded by the flute and clarinet. One variant of the recorder survived into the 19th Century concert halls, however: the keyed recorder known as the csakan or ''''. The art of recorder making never completely died, though. Berchtesgaden Fleitl continue to be made to this day by Bernhard Oeggle, whose great-grandfather Georg learned his craft from Paul Walch (ca 1862-1873), the last of three generations of the Walch family of recorder makers. MacMillan, D. (2007). The Recorder 1800-1905. Recorder Magazine 27(4): 126-131. Tarasov, N. (2005). Bahn frei! Kreative Blockkonstruktionen in 19 Jahrhundert. Windkanal 4: 14-17.) ===Modern revival===  The recorder was revived around the turn of the 20th century by early music enthusiasts, but used almost exclusively for this purpose. It was considered a mainly historical instrument. Even in the early 20th century it was uncommon enough that Stravinsky thought it to be a kind of clarinet, which is not surprising since the early clarinet was, in a sense, derived from the recorder, at least in its outward appearance. Eve E. O'Kelly, ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. ISBN 0-521-36681-X. Chapter 1: The Revival. Thus the revival, far from being the work of one man, was the result of several strands coming and working together. Another famous and popular performer is Michala Petri, who has toured extensively, recorded many discs of old and new pieces, and had quite a number of works written for her. Carl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe, and consequently modern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including Paul Hindemith, Luciano Berio, Josef Tal, John Tavener, Michael Tippett, Benjamin Britten, Leonard Bernstein, Gordon Jacob, Steven Stucky and Edmund Rubbra. The recorder is surprisingly often used in popular music, including that of groups such as the Beatles For example, in ''Fool on the Hill'', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html, and it is also used by Dido. The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S. Lander], the Rolling Stones See, for example, Wikipedia article on Ruby Tuesday (song), Jefferson Airplane See the Wikipedia article section on , as well as the Wikipedia article section on Grace Slick, Led Zeppelin See, for example, Wikipedia article on Stairway to Heaven, Jimi Hendrix For example, in the song '' If 6 Was 9 '', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S. Lander],  For example in the song ''Green Fingers'', according to [http://www.discogs.com/release/386971 Discogs.com's page on the album A Kiss in the Dreamhouse] and Judy Dyble of Fairport Convention  Some modern music calls for the recorder to produce unusual noises, rhythm s and effect s, by such techniques as fluttertonguing and overblowing to produce multiphonics. David Murphy 's 2002 composition ''Bavardage'' is an example, as is Hans Martin Linde's ''Music for a Bird''. ====Use in schools====  In the mid 20th century, manufacturers were able to make recorders out of bakelite and more modern plastics which made them cheap and quick to produce. Because of this, recorders became very popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk. Margo Hall, ''Teaching Kids Recorder'', iUniverse, 2005. ISBN 0-595-36743-7 The success of the recorder in schools is partly responsible for its poor reputation as a "child's instrument". Although the recorder is ready-tuned, it is very easy to warp the pitch by over or under blowing, which often results in an unpleasant sound from beginners. Although it is usually associated with younger school children, some middle and high schools use them during music courses such as music theory. ====Early music re-enactment==== Another area where the recorder has gained popularity is history re-enactment. Since the recorder is a very old instrument, it is extremely suitable for playing Medieval and Baroque music. It is easy to carry and has reasonably loud sound, and can be played both indoors and outdoors. Since many history re-enactors have learned to play recorder already in school, it can be easily adapted in early music, often in combination with other woodwind instruments, such as shawm. ==Makers== The evolution of the Renaissance recorder into the Baroque instrument is generally attributed to the Hotteterre family, in France. They developed the ideas of a more tapered bore, bringing the finger-holes of the lowermost hand closer together, allowing greater range, and enabling the construction of instruments in several jointed sections. The last innovation allowed more accurate shaping of each section and also offered the player minor tuning adjustments, by slightly pulling out one of the sections to lengthen the instrument. The French innovations were taken to London by Pierre Bressan, a set of whose instruments survive in the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, as do other examples in various American, European and Japanese museums and private collections. Bressan's contemporary, Thomas Stanesby, was born in Derbyshire but became an instrument maker in London. He and his son (Thomas Stanesby junior) were the other important British-based recorder-makers of the early eighteenth century. In continental Europe, the Denner family of Nuremberg were the most celebrated makers of this period. Many modern recorders are based on the dimensions and construction of surviving instruments produced by Bressan, the Stanesbys or the Denner family. Information about makers is summarised from sleeve notes of David Munrow's ''The art of the Recorder'', 1975, written by Edgar Hunt, then Head of Renaissance and Baroque music at Trinity College of Music, London A comprehensive database of current recorder makers worldwide is available [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/makers.html here]. ==Recorder ensembles==  The recorder is a very social instrument. Many amateurs enjoy playing in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered. One of the more interesting developments in recorder playing over the last 30 years has been the development of recorder orchestras. They can have 60 or more players and use up to nine sizes of instrument. In addition to arrangements, many new pieces of music, including symphonies, have been written for these ensembles. There are recorder orchestras in Germany, Holland, Japan, the United States, Canada, the UK and several other countries.
