 A '''commissure''' is the place where two things are joined. The term is used especially in the fields of anatomy and biology. In biology, the meeting of the two valves of a brachiopod or clam is a commissure; in botany, the term is used to denote the place where a fern 's laterally expanded vein endings come together in a continuous marginal sorus. ==See also== * Decussation
