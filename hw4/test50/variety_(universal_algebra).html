 In mathematics, specifically universal algebra, a '''variety of algebras''' is the class of all algebraic structure s of a given signature satisfying a given set of identities. Equivalently, a variety is a class of algebraic structures of the same signature which is closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebra s and (direct) products. In the context of category theory, a variety of algebras is usually called a '''finitary algebraic category'''. A '''covariety''' is the class of all coalgebraic structures of a given signature. A variety of algebras should not be confused with an algebraic variety. Intuitively, a variety of algebras is an equationally defined '''collection of algebras''', while an algebraic variety is an equationally defined '''collection of elements from a single algebra'''. The two are named alike by analogy, but they are formally quite distinct and their theories have little in common. ==Birkhoff's theorem==  Garrett Birkhoff proved equivalent the two definitions of variety given above, a result of fundamental importance to universal algebra and known as '''Birkhoff's theorem''' or as the '''HSP theorem'''. '''H''', '''S''', and '''P''' stand, respectively, for the closure  operations of homomorphism, subalgebra, and product ''. ==Examples== The class of all semigroup s forms a variety of algebras of signature (2). A sufficient defining equation is the associative law: : x(yz) = (xy)z. It satisfies the HSP closure requirement, since any homomorphic image, any subset closed under multiplication and any direct product of semigroups is also a semigroup. The class of groups forms a class of algebras of signature (2,1,0), the three operations being respectively ''multiplication'', ''inversion'' and ''identity''. Any subset of a group closed under multiplication, under inversion and under identity (ie. containing the identity) forms a subgroup. Likewise, the collection of groups is closed under homomorphic image and under direct product. Applying Birkhoff's theorem, this is sufficient to tell us that the groups form a variety, and so it should be defined by a collection of identities. In fact, the familiar axioms of associativity, inverse and identity form one suitable set of identities: : x(yz) = (xy)z : 1 x = x 1 = x : x x^{-1} = x^{-1} x = 1. A '''subvariety''' is a subclass of a variety, closed under the operations H, S, P. Notice that although every group is a semigroup, the class of groups does '''not''' form a subvariety of the variety of semigroups. This is because not every sub'''semi'''group of a group is a group. The class of abelian group s, considered again with signature (2,1,0), also has the HSP closure properties. It forms a subvariety of the variety of groups, and can be defined equationally by the three group axioms above together with the commutativity law: : xy = yx. ==Variety of finite algebras== Since varieties are closed under arbitrary cartesian products, all non-trivial varieties contain infinite algebras. It follows that the theory of varieties is of limited use in the study of finite algebras, where one must often apply techniques particular to the finite case. With this in mind, attempts have been made to develop a finitary analogue of the theory of varieties. A '''variety of finite algebras''', sometimes called a '''pseudovariety''', is usually defined to be a class of finite algebras of a given signature, closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras and finitary direct products. There is no general finitary counterpart to Birkhoff's theorem, but in many cases the introduction of a more complex notion of equations allows similar results to be derived. Pseudovarieties are of particular importance in the study of finite semigroup s and hence in formal language theory. Eilenberg's theorem, often referred to as the ''variety theorem'' describes a natural correspondence between varieties of regular language s and pseudovarieties of finite semigroups. ==Category theory== If ''A'' is a finitary algebraic category, then the forgetful functor : U:A\to\bold{Set} is monadic. Even more, it is ''strictly monadic'', in that the comparison functor : K:A\to \bold{Set}^{\mathbb{T}} is an isomorphism (and not just an equivalence). Saunders Mac Lane, ''Categories for the Working Mathematician'', Springer. ''(See p. 152)'' Here, \bold{Set}^{\mathbb{T}} is the Eilenberg-Moore category on \bold{Set}. In general, one says a category is an '''algebraic category''' if it is monadic over \bold{Set}. This is a more general notion than "finitary algebraic category" (the notion of "variety" used in universal algebra) because it admits such categories as '''CABA''' (complete atomic Boolean algebras) and '''CSLat''' (complete semilattices) whose signatures include infinitary operations. In those two cases the signature is large, meaning that it forms not a set but a proper class, because its operations are of unbounded arity. The algebraic category of sigma algebra s also has infinitary operations, but their arity is countable whence its signature is small (forms a set). == See also == * Quasivariety ==Notes== ==References== Two monographs available free online: * Burris, Stanley N., and H.P.
