:''"Eel" often refers to one particular species of Anguilliformes: '' Anguilla anguilla '' (Europe), '''' (East Asia) or '''' (North America).''   | regnum = Animal ia | phylum = Chordata | classis = Actinopterygii | superordo = Elopomorpha | ordo = '''Anguilliformes''' | subdivision_ranks = Suborders | subdivision = Anguilloidei  Congroidei  Nemichthyoidei  Synaphobranchoidei }} "eel" is also used for some other similarly shaped fish, such as electric eel s and spiny eel s, but these are not members of the Anguilliformes order. ==Description== True eels are elongated fishes, ranging in length from  in the one-jawed eel ('' Monognathus ahlstromi'') to  in the giant moray.  They possess no pelvic fin s, and many species also lack pectoral fin s. The dorsal and anal fin s are fused with the caudal or tail fin, to form a single ribbon running along much of the length of the animal.  Most true eels prefer to dwell in shallow waters or hide at the bottom layer of the ocean, sometimes in holes. These holes are called eel pits. Only members of the Anguillidae family regularly inhabit fresh water; they too return to the sea to breed. Some eels dwell in water as deep as . Others are active swimmers. Eels begin life as flat and transparent larvae, called leptocephali. Eel larvae drift in the surface waters of the sea feeding on dissolved nutrients. Eel larvae then morph into glass eels and again into '''elvers''' before finally seeking out the adult habitat. ==Classification==    This classification follows FishBase in dividing the eels into fifteen families. Additional families that are included in other classifications (notably ITIS and Systema Naturae 2000 ) are noted below the family with which they are synomized in the Fish Base system. ==Suborders and families== '''Suborder''' Anguilloidei * Anguillidae ( freshwater eel s) * Chlopsidae ( false moray s) * Heterenchelyidae ( mud eel s) * Moringuidae ( spaghetti eel s) * Muraenidae ( moray eel s) * Myrocongridae ( thin eel s) '''Suborder''' Congroidei * Colocongridae ( worm eel s) * Congridae ( conger s) **Including Macrocephenchelyidae * Derichthyidae ( longneck eel s) **Including Nessorhamphidae * Muraenesocidae ( pike conger s) * Nettastomatidae ( duckbill eel s) * Ophichthidae ( snake eel s) '''Suborder''' Nemichthyoidei * Nemichthyidae ( snipe eel s) * Serrivomeridae ( sawtooth eel s) '''Suborder''' Synaphobranchoidei * Synaphobranchidae ( cutthroat eel s) **Including Dysommidae, Nettodaridae, and Simenchelyidae In some classifications the family Cyematidae of bobtail snipe eel s is included in the Anguilliformes, but in the FishBase system that family is included in the order Saccopharyngiformes. The electric eel of South America is not a true eel, but is more closely related to the Carp. ==Use by humans==  Freshwater eels ('' unagi '') and marine eels ( conger eel, '' anago '') are commonly used in Japanese cuisine - foods such as Unadon and Unajuu are popular but expensive. Eels are also very popular as food in Chinese cuisine, and are prepared in many different ways. Hong Kong eel prices often reached 1000 HKD per kilogram, and once exceeded 5000 HKD per kilogram. Eel is also popular in Korean cuisine and is seen as a source of "stamina" for men. The European eel and other freshwater eels are eaten in Europe, the United States, and other places. A traditional East London food is jellied eels although demand for them significantly declined after World War II. The Basque delicacy ''angulas'' consists of deep-fried elver (young eels). [http://www.buber.net/Basque/Food/food1.html] Eels, particularly the Moray eel, are popular among marine aquarists. Eel blood is toxic to humans , but cooking destroys the toxic protein. The toxin derived from eel blood serum was used by Charles Richet in his Nobel winning research which discovered anaphylaxis (by injecting it into dogs and observing the effect). ==Etymology==  identifies a number of Indo-European cognates, among them the second part of the Latin name of the eels, '' anguilla '', which is attested in its simplex form ''illa'' in a glossary only, and likewise the Greek word for "eel", ''egkhelys'', the second part being attested in Hesychius as ''elyes''. The first compound member, ''anguis'' "snake", is cognate to other Indo-European words for "snake", cf. Old Irish ''escung'' "eel", Old High German ''unc'' "snake" uh uh is''. The word also appears in Old English ''igil'' "hedgehog" (named as the "snake eater"), and perhaps in the ''egi-'' of Old High German ''egidehsa'' "wall lizard". "the slayer of the serpent""snake", directly comparable to Hittite ''ellu-essar-'' "snake pit". This myth likely came to Greece via Anatolia, and in the Hittite version, the dragon is called '' Illuyanka '', the ''illuy-'' part being cognate to the ''illa'' word, and the ''-anka'' part being cognate to the ''angu'' word for "snake". As designations for "snake" ==In human culture== A famous attraction on the French Polynesia n island of Huahine (part of the Society Islands ) is the bridge across a stream hosting  long eels, deemed sacred by local culture. um ==See also==  * Eel life history ==References==  ==External links== *  *
