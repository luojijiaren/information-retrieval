   An '''empanada''' is a stuffed bread or pastry. The name comes from the Spanish and Portuguese verb ''empanar'', meaning to wrap or coat in bread. Empanada is made by folding a dough or bread patty around the stuffing. In Spain, empanadas are usually large and circular in shape and are cut into smaller portions for consumption, whereas in Portugal and South America empanadas are normally small and semi-circular (this type of empanada is also common in the province of Cadiz, Spain). Empanadas are also known by a wide variety of regional names (see the entries for the individual countries below). The empanada may have its origin in the '" muaajanat ",, the savory pastries introduced into Spain and Portugal during the Arabic occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, especially the half-moon-shaped sanbusak, which is also the ancestor of the Indian samosa. Popular in some Arab countries are " muaajanat bi sabaniq maa lahm " (literally, pastries with spinach and meat). In Spain the dish is known as '''' or simply ''empanada'', whereas in Portugal it is only known as "empanada". It is likely that empanadas in the Americas have their origins in Galicia, Spain and Portugal, where an empanada is prepared similar to a large pie which is cut in pieces, making it a portable and hearty meal for working people. The filling of Galician and Portugal empanada usually includes either tuna, sardines or chorizo, but can instead contain cod fish or pork loin. The meat or fish is commonly in a tomato, garlic and onion sauce inside the bread or pastry casing. Due to the large number of Galician immigrants in Latin America, the ''empanada gallega'' has also become popular in that region. The dish was carried to South America by colonists, where they remain very popular to this day.
