     These changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empire s. == Causes ==   Hibbert. Pg 96. or colder climate of the Little Ice Age combined with France's failure to adopt the potato as a staple crop.) [http://www.history.com/shows.do?action=detail&showId;=173249 Little Ice age: Big Chill]. [http://www.history.com/ History Channel].   There were also social and political factors, many of which involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals. These included resentment of royal absolutism; resentment by the ambitious professional and mercantile classes towards noble privileges and dominance in public life, as many of these classes were familiar with the lives of their peers in commercial cities in the Netherlands and Great Britain; resentment by peasants, wage-earners, and the bourgeoisie toward the traditional seigneurial privileges possessed by nobles; resentment of clerical advantage ( anti-clericalism ) and aspirations for freedom of religion, resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy, continued hatred for Catholic control, and influence on institutions of all kinds by the large Protestant minorities; aspirations for liberty and (especially as the Revolution progressed) republicanism; and anger toward the King for firing Jacques Necker and  (among other financial advisors), who were popularly seen as representatives of the people. Doyle 1989, pp.73-74 Finally, perhaps above all, was the almost total failure of Louis XVI and his advisers to deal effectively with any of these problems. ==Pre-revolution== ===Financial crisis=== Louis XVI ascended to the throne amidst a financial crisis; the nation was nearing bankruptcy and outlays outpaced income. Frey, p. 3 In May 1776, finance minister Turgot was dismissed, after he lost favour. The next year, Jacques Necker, a foreigner, was appointed Director-General of Finance. He was not made a minister because he was a Protestant, and could not become a naturalized French citizen. Hibbert, p. 35, 36 Necker realized that the country's tax system subjected some to an unfair burden; numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy. Frey, p. 2 He argued that the country could not be taxed higher, that the nobles and clergy should not be exempt from taxes, and proposed that borrowing would solve the country's fiscal problems. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36,000 livres; and proposed restricting the spending power of the '' parlement s''. This was not received well by the King's ministers and Necker, hoping to solidify his position, argued to be accepted as a minister. The King refused, Necker was fired, and Charles Alexandre de Calonne was appointed to the Directorship. Calonne initially spent liberally, but he quickly realized the critical financial situation and put forth a new tax code. Doyle 2001, p. 34 The proposal included a consistent land tax, which would include taxation of the nobility and clergy, and the meeting of the Estates was planned for May 1789; a signal that the Bourbon monarchy was no longer absolute. Doyle 2001, p. 36 ===Estates-General of 1789===  The Estates-General was organized into three estates, respectively: the clergy, the nobility, and the rest of France. On the last occasion that the Estates-General had met, in 1614, each estate held one vote, and any two could override the third. The ''Parlement'' of Paris feared the government would attempt to gerrymander an assembly to rig the results. Thus, they required that the Estates be arranged as in 1614. Doyle 2001, p. 38  Doyle 1989, p.89 The "Committee of Thirty""the people were sovereign". Neely, p. 56 Necker convened a Second Assembly of the Notables, which rejected the notion of double representation by a vote of 111 to 333. The King, however, agreed to the proposition on 27 December; but he left discussion of the weight of each vote to the Estates-General itself. Hibbert, pp.42-45 Elections were held in the spring of 1789; suffrage requirements were: 25 years of age and over six ''livres'' paid in taxes. Strong turnout produced 1,201 delegates, including: "291 nobles, 300 clergy, and 610 members of the Third Estate." To lead delegates, "Books of grievances" Frey, pp. 4, 5 The books articulated ideas which would have seemed radical only months before; however, most supported the monarchical system in general. Many assumed the Estates-General would approve future taxes, and Enlightenment ideals were relatively rare. Neely, pp. 63, 65 Pamphlets by liberal nobles and clergy became widespread after the lifting of press censorship. "What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been until now in the political order? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something." Furet, p. 45 The Estates-General convened in Versailles on 5 May 1789 and opened with a three hour speech by Necker. The basic strategy of the Third Estate was to make sure that no decisions of the Estates-General should be reached in separate chambers, but instead should be made by all deputies from all three estates together (in other words, the strategy was to merge all three estates into one assembly). Thus they demanded that the verification of deputies' credentials should be undertaken in common by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members internally; but negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this. The commoners appealed to the clergy who replied they required more time. Necker asserted that each estate verify credentials and "the king was to act as arbitrator". Hibbert, p. 54 Negotiations with the other two estates to achieve this, however, were unsuccessful. Schama 2004, p.300-301 ===National Assembly (1789)===   "Commons"), proceed with verification of its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so two days later, completing the process on 17 June. John Hall Stewart. ''A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution''. New York: Macmillan, 1951, p. 86. Then they voted a measure far more radical, declaring themselves the National Assembly, an assembly not of the Estates but of "the People." They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them. Schama 2004, p.303  Schama 2004, p.312 ===Storming of the Bastille===  By this time, Necker had earned the enmity of many members of the French court for his support and guidance to the Third Estate. Marie Antoinette, the King's younger brother the Comte d'Artois, and other conservative members of the King's privy council urged him to dismiss Necker from his role as King's financial advisor. On 11 July 1789, after Necker suggested that the royal family live according to a budget to conserve funds, the King fired him, and completely reconstructed the finance ministry at the same time. Schama 2004, p.317 Many Parisians presumed Louis's actions to be the start of a royal coup by the conservatives and began open rebellion when they heard the news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers-mostly foreigners under French service rather than native French troops& Schama 2004, p.331  Schama 2004, p.344  The King and his military supporters backed down, at least for the time being. La Fayette took up command of the National Guard at Paris. Jean-Sylvain Bailly, president of the Assembly at the time of the Tennis Court Oath, became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the ''commune''. The King visited Paris, where, on 17 July he accepted a tricolore  cockade, to cries of ''Vive la Nation'' [Long live the Nation] and ''Vive le Roi'' [Long live the King]. Schama 2004, p.357 Necker was recalled to power, but his triumph was short-lived. An astute financier but a less astute politician, Necker overplayed his hand by demanding and obtaining a general amnesty, losing much of the people's favour. He also felt he could save France all by himself, despite having few ideas. "la Grande Peur" (the Great Fear ). In addition, plotting at Versailles and the large numbers of men on the roads of France as a result of unemployment led to wild rumours and paranoia (particularly in the rural areas) that caused widespread unrest and civil disturbances and contributed to the Great Fear. Hibbert, 93 ===Working toward a constitution===   On 4 August 1789 the National Constituent Assembly abolished feudalism (although at that point there had been sufficient peasant revolts to almost end feudalism already), in what is known as the August Decrees, sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate and the tithe s gathered by the First Estate. In the course of a few hours, nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies, and cities lost their special privileges. Looking to the Declaration of Independence of the United States for a model, on 26 August 1789, the Assembly published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Like the U.S. Declaration, it comprised a statement of principles rather than a constitution with legal effect. The National Constituent Assembly functioned not only as a legislature, but also as a body to draft a new constitution. Necker, Mounier, Lally-Tollendal and others argued unsuccessfully for a senate, with members appointed by the crown on the nomination of the people. The bulk of the nobles argued for an aristocratic upper house elected by the nobles. The popular party carried the day: France would have a single, unicameral assembly. The King retained only a "suspensive veto" ===Women's March on Versailles===    Doyle 1989, p.121 The women were responding to the harsh economic situations they faced, especially bread shortages. They also demanded an end to Royalist efforts to block the National Assembly, and for the King and his administration to move to Paris as a sign of good faith in addressing the widespread poverty. Getting unsatisfactory responses from city officials, as many as 7,000 women joined the march to Versailles, bringing with them pieces of cannon and a variety of smaller weapons. Twenty thousand National Guardsmen under the command of La Fayette responded to keep order, and members of the mob stormed the palace, killing several guards. Doyle 1989, p.122 La Fayette ultimately convinced the king to accede to the demand of the crowd that the monarchy relocate to Paris. On 6 October 1789, the King and the royal family moved from Versailles to Paris under the protection of the National Guards, thus legitimizing the National Assembly. ===Revolution and the Church===  Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 4. The Church was exempt from paying taxes to the government, however it levied a tithe - a tenth tax on income often collected in the form of crops - on the general population. Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 4. The power and wealth of the Church was highly resented. Non-Catholics and Protestants wanted an anti-Catholic regime and revenge against the clergy in power. Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire helped fuel this resentment by denigrating the Catholic Church and destabilizing the French monarchy. Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 16. John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 5. This resentment toward the Church weakened its power during the opening of the Estates General in May of 1789. The Church composed the First Estate with 130,000 members of the clergy. When the National Assembly was later created in June 1789 by the Third Estate, the clergy voted to join them, which perpetuated the destruction of the Estates General as a governing body. John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 50, 4. National Assembly legislation cited in John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27. They used this property to back a new currency, the assignats. However, the nation had now taken on the responsibility of the Church, which included paying the clergy and caring for the poor. John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27. In December the Assembly began to sell the lands to the highest bidder in order to raise revenue, effectively decreasing the value of the assignats by 25 percent in two years. Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 61. In autumn of 1789, legislation abolished monastic vows and on 13 February 1790 all religious orders were dissolved. Emmet Kennedy, A Cultural History of the French Revolution, 148. Monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life and 10 percent eventually married. Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 92. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy, passed on 12 July 1790, turned the remaining clergy into employees of the state. This established an election system for parish priests and bishops and set a pay rate for the clergy. Many Catholics objected to the election system because non-Catholics could participate in the election of their priests and bishops. Eventually, in November 1790, the National Assembly began to require an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution from all the members of the clergy. Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 92. This led to a schism between those clergy who swore the required oath and accepted the new arrangement and those who refused to do so. Overall 54 percent of the clergy nationwide took the oath. Emmet Kennedy, A Cultural History of the French Revolution, 151. Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 61. The Pope Pius VI never accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, further isolating the Church in France. During the Reign of Terror, extreme efforts of de-Christianization ensued, including the imprisonment and massacre of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace altogether the Catholic Church with civic festivals. The establishment of the cult of Reason was the final step of radical de-Christianization. However, locals often resisted these efforts and even Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety eventually denounced this campaign. Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 92-94. The Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and the Church ended the de-Christianization period and established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the Third Republic via the separation of church and state on 11 December 1905. ===Appearance of factions===   "Royalist democrats" The "National Party" ===Intrigues and radicalism=== -armorial bearings, liveries, etc.&"fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king"; and the King and the royal family actively participated. Schama 2004, p.433-434 The electors had originally chosen the members of the Estates-General to serve for a single year. However, by the terms of the Tennis Court Oath, the ''communes'' had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution. Right-wing elements now argued for a new election, but Mirabeau carried the day, asserting that the status of the assembly had fundamentally changed, and that no new election should take place before completing the constitution. In late 1790, several small counter-revolutionary uprisings broke out and efforts took place to turn all or part of the army against the Revolution. These uniformly failed. The royal court "encouraged every anti-revolutionary enterprise and avowed none." This period saw the rise of the political "clubs" in French politics, foremost among these the Jacobin Club; 152 clubs had affiliated with the Jacobins by 10 August 1790. Schama 2004, p.449 As the Jacobins became more of a broad popular organisation, some of its founders abandoned it to form the Club of '89. Royalists established first the short-lived '' Club des Impartiaux '' and later the '' Club Monarchique ''. The latter attempted unsuccessfully to curry public favour by distributing bread. Nonetheless, they became the frequent target of protests and even riots, and the Paris municipal authorities finally closed down the Club Monarchique in January 1791. Amidst these intrigues, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organisation made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trial s started for criminal cases. The King would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers' organisations: any individual gained the right to practice a trade through the purchase of a license; strikes became illegal. Schama 2004, p.442 "worthy of being placed in the code of Draco ". But Mirabeau died on 2 April 1791 and, before the end of the year, the new Legislative Assembly would adopt this "draconian" measure. Schama 2004, p.496 ===Royal flight to Varennes===   Lindqvist, Herman (1991). Axel von Fersen. Stockholm: Fischer & Co Loomis, Stanley (1972). The Fatal Friendship. Avon Books - ISBN 0931933331 Timothy Tackett, When the King Took Flight (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2003) http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/France/_Texts/CROROY/Fuite_de_Varennes*.html ===Completing the constitution===   As most of the Assembly still favoured a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic, the various groupings reached a compromise which left Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead: he had perforce to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to ''de facto'' abdication. Jacques Pierre Brissot drafted a petition, insisting that in the eyes of the nation Louis XVI was deposed since his flight. An immense crowd gathered in the Champ de Mars to sign the petition. Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins gave fiery speeches. The Assembly called for the municipal authorities to "preserve public order". The National Guard under La Fayette's command confronted the crowd. The soldiers responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd, thus killing between 13 and 50 people. Schama 2004, p.481 In the wake of this massacre the authorities closed many of the patriotic clubs, as well as radical newspapers such as Jean-Paul Marat 's '' L'Ami du Peuple ''. Danton fled to England; Desmoulins and Marat went into hiding. Meanwhile, a new threat arose from abroad: Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, Frederick William II of Prussia, and the King's brother Charles-Philippe, comte d'Artois issued the Declaration of Pillnitz which considered the cause of Louis XVI as their own, demanded his absolute liberty and implied an invasion of France on his behalf if the revolutionary authorities refused its conditions. Schama 2004, p.500 The French people expressed no respect for the dictates of foreign monarchs, and the threat of force merely caused the militarisation of the frontiers. Even before his "Flight to Varennes", the Assembly members had determined to debar themselves from the legislature that would succeed them, the Legislative Assembly. They now gathered the various constitutional laws they had passed into a single constitution, showed remarkable strength in choosing not to use this as an occasion for major revisions, and submitted it to the recently restored Louis XVI, who accepted it, writing "I engage to maintain it at home, to defend it from all attacks from abroad, and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal". The King addressed the Assembly and received enthusiastic applause from members and spectators. The Assembly set the end of its term for 29 September 1791. Mignet argued that the "constitution of 1791... was the work of the middle class, then the strongest; for, as is well known, the predominant force ever takes possession of institutions... In this constitution the people was the source of all powers, but it exercised none." ===Failure of the constitutional monarchy===   "In the attempt to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. It left behind an empty treasury, an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and successful riot."  ===Constitutional crisis===    On the night of 10 August 1792, insurgents, supported by a new revolutionary Paris Commune, assailed the Tuileries. The King and queen ended up prisoners and a rump session of the Legislative Assembly suspended the monarchy; little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins. What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune. The Commune sent gangs into the prisons to try arbitrarily and butcher 1400 victims, and addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France inviting them to follow this example. The Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. This situation persisted until the Convention, charged with writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new ''de facto'' government of France. The next day it abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. This date was later retroactively adopted as the beginning of Year One of the French Republican Calendar.    The politics of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies. The King, the Feuillants and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war. The King (and many Feuillants with him) expected war would increase his personal popularity; he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat: either result would make him stronger. The Girondins wanted to export the Revolution throughout Europe and, by extension, to defend the Revolution within France. Only some of the radical Jacobin s opposed war, preferring to consolidate and expand the Revolution at home. The Austrian emperor  Leopold II, brother of Marie Antoinette, may have wished to avoid war, but he died on 1 March 1792. Schama 2004, p.505 France declared war on Austria (20 April 1792) and Prussia joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later. The invading Prussian army faced little resistance until checked at the Battle of Valmy (20 September 1792), and forced to withdraw. However, by this time, France stood in turmoil and the monarchy had effectively become a thing of the past.   ===Execution of Louis XVI===   In the Brunswick Manifesto, the Imperial and Prussian armies threatened retaliation on the French population if it were to resist their advance or the reinstatement of the monarchy. This made Louis appear to be conspiring with the enemies of France. 17 January 1793 saw Louis condemned to death for "conspiracy against the public liberty and the general safety" by a close majority in Convention: 361 voted to execute the king, 288 voted against, and another 72 voted to execute him subject to a variety of delaying conditions. The former Louis XVI, now simply named ''Citoyen Louis Capet'' (Citizen Louis Capet), was executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793 in the area now called the Place de la Concorde. After he was executed, some of the citizens who witnessed the beheading ran forth to have their clothes soaked in the late King's blood, dripping from his head. Doyle 2002, p. 196 Others in the crowd went mad, slit their throats or jumped into the river Seine  "an act that secularized the French world and banished God from the subsequent history of the French people". The 21 January execution led to more wars with other European countries. Louis' Austrian-born queen, Marie Antoinette, would follow him to the guillotine on 16 October.  ===Economy=== "The Law of the Maximum"]] set food prices and led to executions of offenders. White, E. "The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770-1815." ''The Journal of Economic History'' 1995, p 244 This policy of price control was coeval with the Committee of Public Safety 's rise to power and the Reign of Terror. The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products, but by September of 1793 it expanded the "maximum" to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods. Schuettinger, Robert. "Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls." Heritage Foundation, 2009. p. 45 Widespread shortages and famine ensued. The Committee reacted by sending dragoons into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops. This temporarily solved the problem in Paris, but the rest of the country suffered. By the spring of 1794 forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered. When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered, "There goes the dirty maximum!" Bourne, Henry. "Maximum Prices in France." American Historical Review, October 1917, p. 112. ===Reign of Terror===  The Committee of Public Safety came under the control of Maximilien Robespierre, a lawyer, and the Jacobins unleashed the Reign of Terror (1793-1794). According to archival records, at least 16,594 people died under the guillotine or otherwise after accusations of counter-revolutionary activities.  A number of historians note that as many as 40,000 accused prisoners may have been summarily executed without trial or died awaiting trial. Doyle 1989, p. 258 On 2 June 1793, Paris sections &"enraged ones"- took over the Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral franchise to " sans-culottes " alone. Schama 2004, p.616 "the Incorruptible", became its most influential member as it moved to take radical measures against the Revolution's domestic and foreign enemies. Schama 2004, p.641 Meanwhile, on 24 June, the Convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, variously referred to as the French Constitution of 1793 or Constitution of the Year I. It was progressive and radical in several respects, in particular by establishing universal male suffrage. It was ratified by public referendum, but never applied, because normal legal processes were suspended before it could take effect. Schama 2004, p.637  [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DB1231F934A25755C0A96F948260&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=all In a Corner of France, Long Live the Old Regime], New York Times North of the Loire, similar revolts were started by the so-called Chouans (royalist rebels).

It has been hypothesized that if the letter is authentic, that may have been Westermann's attempt to exaggerate the intensity of his actions and his success, because he was eager to avoid being purged for his incompetent military leadership and for his opposition to sans-culotte generals (he failed to avoid that, since he was guillotined together with Danton's group). The revolt and its suppression (including both combat casualties and massacres and executions on both sides) are thought to have taken between 117 000 and 250 000 lives (170 000 according to the latest estimates). Because of the extremely brutal forms that the Republican repression took in many places, certain historians such as Reynald Secher have called the event a " genocide ". This description has become popular in the mass media, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DB1231F934A25755C0A96F948260&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=all In a Corner of France, Long Live the Old Regime].

Under control of the effectively dictatorial Committee, the Convention quickly enacted more legislation. On 9 September, the Convention established ''sans-culottes'' paramilitary forces, the ''revolutionary armies'', to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September, the '' Law of Suspects '' was passed, which authorized the charging of counter-revolutionaries with vaguely defined crimes against liberty. On 29 September, the Convention extended price-fixing from grain and bread to other household goods and declared the right to set a limit on wages.

Schama 2004, p.706 ===Thermidorian Reaction===  "Closing of the Jacobin Club, during the night of 27-28 July 1794, or 9-10 Thermidor, year 2 of the Republic"]] On 27 July 1794, the Thermidorian Reaction led to the arrest and execution of Robespierre and Louis de Saint-Just. The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror, and after taking power, they took revenge as well by persecuting even those Jacobins who had helped to overthrow Robespierre, banning the Jacobin Club, and executing many of its former members in what was known as the White Terror. In the wake of excesses of the Terror, the Convention approved the new "Constitution of the Year III" on 22 August 1795. A French plebiscite ratified the document, with about 1,057,000 votes for the constitution and 49,000 against. Doyle 1989, p.320 The results of the voting were announced on 23 September 1795, and the new constitution took effect on 27 September 1795.   The new constitution created the ''Directoire'' () and the first bicameral legislature in French history. Cole et al 1989, p.39 The parliament consisted of 500 representatives - the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents'' (Council of the Five Hundred) - and 250 senators - the ''Conseil des Anciens'' (Council of Elders). Executive power went to five "directors," named annually by the ''Conseil des Anciens'' from a list submitted by the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents''. Furthermore, the universal suffrage of 1793 was replaced by limited suffrage based on property. As many French citizens distrusted the Directory, Doyle 1989, p.331 the directors could achieve their purposes only by extraordinary means. They habitually disregarded the terms of the constitution, and, even when the elections that they rigged went against them, Doyle 1989, p.332 the directors routinely used draconian police measures to quell dissent. Moreover, the Directory used war as the best expedient for prolonging their power, and the directors were thus driven to rely on the armies, which also desired war and grew less and less civic-minded. On 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire of the Year VIII) Napoleon Bonaparte staged the '' coup of 18 Brumaire '' which installed the Consulate. This effectively led to Bonaparte's dictatorship and eventually (in 1804) to his proclamation as ''Empereur'' (emperor), which brought to a close the specifically republic an phase of the French Revolution. ==Women in the Revolution==.. ===Militant Feminism in the Revolution===  The March to Versailles is but one example of feminist militant activism during the French Revolution.
