 == History == Neuss was founded by the Romans in 16 BC as a military fortification ('' castra '') with the current city to the north of the castra, on the confluence of the rivers Rhine and Erft, with the name of '''Novaesium'''. Later a civil settlement was founded in the area of today's center of the town during the 1st century AD. Novaesium, together with Augsburg (''Augusta Vindelicorum'') and Trier (''Augusta Treverorum''), is one of the three oldest Roman settlements in Germany. Neuss grew during the Middle Ages because of its prime location on several routes, by the crossing of the great Rhine valley, and with its harbour and ferry. During the 10th century, the remains of the martyr and tribune  Saint Quirinus, not to be confused with the Roman god Quirinus, had been relocated to Neuss. This resulted in pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Quirinus even from countries beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. Neuss was first documented as a town in 1138. One of the main events in the town's history is the  by Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, that lasted for nearly a year. The citizens of Neuss withstood the siege and were therefore rewarded by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. The town was granted the right to mint its own coins and to carry the imperial coat of arms, the imperial eagle and the crown, in the town's own coat of arms. Neuss became a member of the Hanseatic League, although it was never accepted by the other members of the League. In 1586, more than two-thirds of the city was destroyed by fire, and several wars during the reign of King Louis XIV of France resulted in worsening finances for Neuss. Its importance as a place for trading declined rapidly, and from the mid-17th century onwards, Neuss became a place only important for its agriculture.   From 1794&-22) and its successor, the Rhine Province (1822- 1946). Neuss regained its economic power in the 19th century, with expansion of the harbour in 1835, and increasing industrial activity. The city's boundaries were expanded in 1881. Neuss became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. ==Points of interest== * Botanischer Garten der Stadt Neuss, the city's botanical garden ==Twinnings== *  Pskow, Russia, since 1990 *  Rijeka, Croatia, since 1990 *  Saint Paul, United States, since 1999  == External links == * [http://www.neuss.de Official website]
