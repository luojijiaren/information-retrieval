In the 17th century, the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918, and Bavaria has since been a free state (republic). It is the only modern state of Germany which never belonged to the Hanseatic League. Bavaria is a predominantly Catholic state with a distinct culture. Modern Bavaria also includes parts of the historical regions of Franconia and Swabia. ==History==  The Bavarians emerged in a region north of the Alps, originally inhabited by the Gauls, which had been part of the Roman provinces of Raethia and Noricum. The Bavarians spoke Old High German but, unlike other Germanic groups, did not migrate from elsewhere. Rather, they seem to have coalesced out of other groups left behind by Roman withdrawal late in the 5th century AD. These peoples may have included the Celtic Boii, some remaining Romans, Marcomanni, Allemanni, Quadi, Thuringians, Goths, Scirians, Rugians, Heruli. The name "Bavarian" (" Baiuvarii ") means "Men of Baia" which may indicate Bohemia, the homeland of the Celtic Boii and later of the Marcomanni. They first appear in written sources circa 520. Saint Boniface completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early-8th century. Bavaria was, for the most part, unaffected by the Protestant Reformation, and even today, most of it is strongly Roman Catholic. From about 550, more exactly probably 554, to 788 the house of Agilolfing ruled the Duchy of Bavaria, ending with Tassilo III who was deposed by Charlemagne. Three early dukes are named in Frankish sources: Garibald I may have been appointed to the office by the Merovingian kings and married the Lombard princess Walderada when the church forbade her to King Chlothar I in 555. Their daughter, Theodelinde, became Queen of the Lombards in northern Italy and Garibald was forced to flee to her when he fell out with his Frankish overlords. Garibald's successor, Tassilo I, tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of Slavs and Avars around 600. Tassilo's son Garibald II seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616. After Garibald II little is known of the Bavarians until , whose reign may have begun as early as 680. From 696 onwards he invited churchmen from the west to organize churches and strengthen Christianity in his duchy (it is unclear what Bavarian religious life consisted of before this time). His son, Theudebert, led a decisive Bavarian campaign to intervene in a succession dispute in the Lombard Kingdom in 714, and married his sister Guntrud to the Lombard King Liutprand. At Theodo's death the duchy was divided among his sons, but reunited under his grandson Hucbert. At Hucbert's death (735 AD) the duchy passed to a distant relative named Odilo, from neighbouring Alemannia (modern southwest Germany and northern Switzerland). Odilo issued a law code for Bavaria, completed the process of church organisation in partnership with St. Boniface (739), and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the Carolingian  Grifo. He was defeated near Augsburg in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748. ===Middle Ages===  Tassilo III (b. 741 - d. after 794) succeeded his father at the age of eight after an unsuccessful attempt by Grifo to rule Bavaria. He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onwards. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the River Danube and colonising these lands. After 781, however, his cousin Charlemagne began to pressure Tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. The deposition was not entirely legitimate; Dissenters attempted a coup against Charlemagne at Tassilo's old capital of Regensburg in 792, led by his own son Pippin the Hunchback, and the king had to drag Tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the Assembly of Frankfurt in 794. This is the last appearance of Tassilo in the sources and he probably died a monk. As all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the Agilolfing dynasty. For the next 400 years numerous families held the duchy, rarely for more than three generations. With the revolt of duke Henry the Quarrelsome in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and south east. Among them a mark called "Ostarrichi" which was elevated to a duchy out of own right and given to the Babenberger family. This event marks the birth of Austria. The last, and one of the most important, of these dukes was Henry the Lion of the house of Welf, founder of Munich, de facto the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of Saxony and Bavaria by his cousin, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor (aka "Barbarossa" for his red beard), Bavaria was awarded as fief to the Wittelsbach family, counts palatinate of Schyren ("Scheyern" in modern German), which ruled from 1180 to 1918. The Electoral Palatinate by Rhine ("Kurpfalz" in German) was also acquired by the House of Wittelsbach in 1214. The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the Hohenstaufen in 1268 also Swabia n territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes. Emperor Louis the Bavarian acquired Brandenburg, Tirol, Holland and Hainaut for his House but released the Upper Palatinate for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. In 1506 with the Landshut War of Succession the other parts of Bavaria were reunited and Munich became the sole capital. ===Modern Era=== In 1623 the Bavarian duke replaced his relative, the Count Palatine of the Rhine in the early days of the Thirty Years' War and acquired the powerful prince-elector al dignity in the Holy Roman Empire, determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empire's laws. The country became one of the centres of Jesuite supported counter-reformation. The ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with and occupations by Austria during the early and mid-18th century (Spanish succession, election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburger). From 1777 onwards, after the old Bavarian branch of the family had died out with elector Max III. Joseph, Bavaria and the Electoral Palatinate were governed in personal union again, now by the Palatinian lines. ===Kingdom of Bavaria===  When Napoleon abolished the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria became a kingdom in 1806, and its area doubled. Tirol was temporarily united, Salzburg temporarily reunited with Bavaria but finally ceded to Austria. In return the Rhenish Palatinate and Franconia were annexed to Bavaria in 1815. Between 1799 and 1817 the leading minister count Montgelas followed a strict policy of modernisation and laid the foundations of administrative structures that survived even the monarchy and are (in their core) valid until today. In 1808 a first and in 1818 a more modern constitution (by the standards of the time) was passed, that established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords ( ) and a House of Commons ( ''Kammer der Abgeordneten'' ). The constitution was valid until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of World War I. === Bavaria as a part of the German Empire === In the early-20th century Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Henrik Ibsen, and other notable artists were drawn to Bavaria, notably to the Schwabing district of Munich, later devastated by World War II.  ===20th century=== On November 12, 1918, Ludwig III signed a document, the Anif declaration, releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths; the newly-formed republican government of Socialist premier Kurt Eisner interpreted this as an abdication. (To date, however, no member of the house of Wittelsbach has ever formally declared renunciation of the throne. On the other hand, none has ever since officially called upon their Bavarian or Stewart claims. Family members are active in cultural and social life, including the head of the house, HRH Duke Franz in Bavaria. They step back from any announcements on public affairs, showing approval or disapproval solely by HRH's presence or absence.) Eisner was assassinated in 1919 leading to a violently suppressed Communist revolt. Extremist activity by the National Socialists also increased, notably the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, and Munich and Nuremberg became Nazi strongholds under the Third Reich. As a manufacturing center, Munich was heavily bombed during World War II and occupied by U.S. troops. The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state Rhineland-Palatinate. Since World War II, Bavaria has been rehabilitated from a poor agrarian country into a prosperous industrial hub. A massive reconstruction effort restored much of Munich's and other places historic cores. The state capital hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics and matches of the Soccer World Cups of 1974 and 2006 as well as European Track & Field championships. More recently, former state minister-president Edmund Stoiber was the CDU/CSU candidate for chancellor in the 2002 federal election which he lost, and native son Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. ==Geography==  Bavaria shares international borders with Austria and the Czech Republic as well as with Switzerland (across Lake Constance ). Neighbouring states within Germany are, Hesse, Thuringia and Saxony. Two major rivers flow through the state, the Danube ( ''Donau'' ) and the Main. The Bavarian Alps define the border with Austria, and within the range is the highest peak in Germany, the Zugspitze. The major cities in Bavaria are Munich ( ), Nuremberg ( ), Augsburg, Regensburg,, Ingolstadt, and Erlangen. ===Population and area=== {| class="wikitable" |- bgcolor=lightgrey! | Administrative region! colspan="2" | Population (2008)! colspan="2"! colspan="2" | No. municipalities |- | Lower Bavaria | align="right" | 1,193,444 | align="right" | 9.5% | align="right" | 10,330 | align="right" | 14.6% | align="right" | 258 | align="right" | 12.5% |- | Lower Franconia | align="right" | 1,331,500 | align="right" | 10.6% | align="right" | 8,531 | align="right" | 12.1% | align="right" | 308 | align="right" | 15.0% |- | Upper Franconia | align="right" | 1,085,770 | align="right" | 8.7% | align="right" | 7,231 | align="right" | 10.2% | align="right" | 214 | align="right" | 10.4% |- | Middle Franconia | align="right" | 1,714,453 | align="right" | 13.7% | align="right" | 7,245 | align="right" | 10.3% | align="right" | 210 | align="right" | 10.2% |- | Upper Palatinate | align="right" | 1,085,216 | align="right" | 8.7% | align="right" | 9,691 | align="right" | 13.7% | align="right" | 226 | align="right" | 11.0% |- | Swabia | align="right" | 1,787,995 | align="right" | 14.3% | align="right" | 9,992 | align="right" | 14.2% | align="right" | 340 | align="right" | 16.5% |- | Upper Bavaria | align="right" | 4,320,934 | align="right" | 34.5% | align="right" | 17,530 | align="right" | 24.8% | align="right" | 500 | align="right" | 24.3% |- |- bgcolor=lightgrey!

Together with the 25 independent cities (which are in effect municipalities independent of ''Landkreis'' administrations), there are a total of 2056 municipalities in Bavaria. In 44 of the 71 administrative districts, there are a total of 215 unincorporated area s (as of January 1, 2005, called ''gemeindefreie Gebiete'', singular ''gemeindefreies Gebiet'' ), not belonging to any municipality, all uninhabited, mostly forested areas, but also four lakes ( Chiemsee -without islands, Starnberger See -without island Roseninsel, Ammersee, which are the three largest lakes of Bavaria, and Waginger See ). ==Politics==  Bavaria has a multi-party system where the biggest parties are the conservative Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU), which has dominated politics since 1957 and won every election since then, and the center-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The German green party,  is represented in the parliament as well. Since 2008 Germany's liberal party, the Free Democratic Party and the Free Voters are represented in Bavaria's parliament as well. CSU and FDP agreed in October 2008 to form a coalition, while SPD, Free Voters and the Greens form the opposition. Bavaria has a unicameral  '' Landtag '', or state parliament, elected by universal suffrage. Until December 1999, there was also a ''Senat'', or Senate, whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished. The head of government is the Minister-President. In 1995 Bavaria introduced direct democracy on the local level in a referendum. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called ''Mehr Demokratie'' In the 2003 elections the CSU won more than two thirds of the seats in Landtag - something no party had ever achieved in post-war German history. In the following 2008 elections the CSU lost its absolute majority in the Landtag for the first time in 46 years. === Minister-presidents of Bavaria since 1945 === {| class="prettytable"! style="background:#EEEEFF" align="center" colspan="6" | Minister-presidents of Bavaria |- style="background:#EEEEFF"!

However, state legislation regulating citizenship procedures has never been enacted, the constitution itself provides that all Germans enjoy the same rights as Bavarian citizens, and no office issues certificates concerning a "Bavarian" citizenship. Thus, the notion of citizenship rather bears a folkloric, but not really political meaning. Some people in the northern part of Bavaria, acquired only during the Congress of Vienna, see themselves as Franconians and therefore do not like to be called Bavarians. They have a separate dialect and do not wear traditional Bavarian clothing, but their own. ===German-Bavarian relations=== It is a common joke in Germany that Bavaria is not part of Germany, but "near it". In fact a minority seriously agrees with this notion; the '' Bayernpartei '' (Bavaria Party) advocates Bavarian independence from Germany. Bavaria was the only state to reject the West German constitution in 1949, but this did not prevent its implementation. Some NGOs ( non-governmental organizations ) have both a German and a Bavarian branch; for example, there is a Bavarian as well as a German Red Cross. One of Germany's principal political parties, the CDU ( Christian Democratic Union ), is replaced in Bavaria by the [http://www.csu.de CSU], but in practice the two parties cooperate fully in the Bundestag. Bavaria fielded its own border police force, much like the Federal German Grenzschutz, during the Cold War. ==Economy== Bavaria has long had one of the largest and healthiest economies of any region in Germany, or Europe for that matter. Its GDP is 143% of the EU average (as of 2005) against a German average of 121.5%, see [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/extraction/evalight/EVAlight.jsp?A=1&language;=en&root;=/theme1/reg/reg_e2gdp Eurostat] Its GDP in 2007 exceeded 434 billion Euros (about 600 bn US$) ] This makes Bavaria itself one of the largest economies in Europe and the 18th largest in the world. See the list of countries by GDP (nominal). Some large companies headquarted in Bavaria include BMW, Siemens, Audi, Munich Re, Allianz, Infineon, MAN, Wacker Chemie, Puma AG,and Adidas AG. (See also .) ==Culture==   Some features of the Bavarian culture and mentality are remarkably distinct from the rest of Germany. Noteworthy differences (especially in rural areas, less significant in the major cities) can be found with respect to: ===Religion=== The predominant faith is Roman Catholicism, particularly in the southern parts of Bavaria and Lower Franconia. As per the most recent available ''Kirchliche Statistik Eckdaten'' from the ''Deutsche Bischofskonferenz'', Bavaria is one of two with a population that is in majority Catholic (though in several additional, a plurality of the population is Catholic). This source indicates that in 2007, 56.4% of the Bavarian population was Catholic, and 21.0% Protestant. The current pope, Benedict XVI ( Joseph Alois Ratzinger ), was born in Marktl am Inn in Upper Bavaria and was Cardinal- Archbishop of Munich and Freising. In addition, Lutheranism has a significant presence in large parts of Franconia. Religion remains important to many in the region, as expressed by the typical Bavarian, Austrian and Swabian greeting: "" (''Greet God!'', originally "" - "God may bless you"). ===Traditions=== Bavarians commonly emphasize pride in their traditions. Traditional costumes collectively known as Tracht are worn on special occasions and include in Altbayern  Lederhosen for males and Dirndl for females. Centuries-old folk music is performed. The Maibaum, or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's yellow pages, as figurettes on the pole represent the trades of the village), and the bagpipes in the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the ancient Celtic and Germanic remnants of cultural heritage of the region. Whether actually in Bavaria, overseas or full citizens of other nations they continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their traditions alive. In New York the German American Cultural Society is a larger umbrella group for others such as the Bavarian organizations, which represent a specific part of Germany. They proudly put forth a German Parade called Steuben Parade each year. Various affiliated events take place amongst its groups, one of which is the Bavarian Dancers. ===Food and drink=== Bavaria is also home to the Franconia wine region, which is situated along the Main River in Franconia. The region has produced wine for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the Bocksbeutel wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfests) throughout the year.  ===Language and dialects===   Three German dialects and languages are spoken in Bavaria: Austro-Bavarian in Old Bavaria (South East and East), Swabian German (an Alemannic German dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (South West) and East Franconian German in Franconia (North). Bavarians are very proud of their marked dialect s, and most of them speak with their Bavarian, Franconian or Swabian accent. As with traditions in general, cultivation of dialect and regional accent is considered a strengthening of regional identity. ===Ethnography=== Bavarians consider themselves to be egalitarian and informal. Their sociability can be experienced at the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous beer gardens. In traditional Bavarian beer garden s, patrons may bring their own food and only buy beer from the brewery that runs the beer garden.  In the United States, particularly among German American s, Bavarian culture is viewed somewhat nostalgically, and many "Bavarian villages", most notably Frankenmuth, Michigan and Leavenworth, Washington, have been founded.
