    In modern molecular biology, the '''genome''' is the entirety of an organism's hereditary information. It is encoded either in DNA or, for many types of virus, in RNA. The genome includes both the gene s and the non-coding sequences of the DNA. Ridley, M. (2006). ''Genome''. New York, NY: Harper Perennial. ISBN 0-06-019497-9 The term was adapted in 1920 by Hans Winkler, Professor of Botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany. The Oxford English Dictionary suggests the name to be a portmanteau of the words '''''gen'''e'' and ''chromos'''ome'''''. A few related ''-ome'' words already existed, such as '' biome '' and '' rhizome '', forming a vocabulary into which ''genome'' fits systematically.  Some organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes, diploid, triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya ) the gamete has half of the number of chromosome of the somatic cell and the '''genome''' is a full set of chromosome s in a gamete. In haploid  organism s, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts, or virus es, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular and/or linear chains of DNA (or RNA for some viruses ), likewise constitute the ''genome''. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean that stored on a complete set of '' nuclear DNA'' (i.e., the "nuclear genome") but can also be applied to that stored within organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the " mitochondrial genome " or the " chloroplast genome". Additionally, the genome can comprise nonchromosomal genetic elements such as virus es, plasmid s, and transposable element s . When people say that the genome of a sexually reproducing  species has been " sequenced ", typically they are referring to a determination of the sequences of one set of autosome s and one of each type of sex chromosome, which together represent both of the possible sexes. Even in species that exist in only one sex, what is described as "a genome sequence" may be a composite read from the chromosomes of various individuals. In general use, the phrase "genetic makeup" is sometimes used conversationally to mean the genome of a particular individual or organism. The study of the global properties of genomes of related organisms is usually referred to as genomics, which distinguishes it from genetics which generally studies the properties of single gene s or groups of genes. Both the number of base pair s and the number of genes vary widely from one species to another, and there is only a rough correlation between the two (an observation known as the C-value paradox ). At present, the highest known number of genes is around 60,000, for the protozoan causing trichomoniasis (see List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes ), almost three times as many as in the human genome. An analogy to the human genome stored on DNA is that of instructions stored in a library: * The library would contain 46 books (chromosomes) * The books range in size from 400 to 3340 pages (genes) * which is 48 to 250 million letters (A,C,G,T) per book. * Hence the library contains over six billion letters total; * The library fits into a cell nucleus the size of a pinpoint; * A copy of the library (all 46 books) is contained in almost every cell of our body. == Types == Most biological entities that are more complex than a virus sometimes or always carry additional genetic material besides that which resides in their chromosomes. In some contexts, such as sequencing the genome of a pathogenic microbe, "genome" is meant to include information stored on this auxiliary material, which is carried in plasmid s. In such circumstances then, "genome" describes all of the genes and information on non-coding DNA that have the potential to be present. In eukaryote s such as plants, protozoa and animals, however, "genome" carries the typical connotation of only information on chromosomal DNA. So although these organisms contain chloroplasts and/or mitochondria that have their own DNA, the genetic information contained by DNA within these organelles is not considered part of the genome. In fact, mitochondria are sometimes said to have their own genome often referred to as the " mitochondrial genome ". The DNA found within the chloroplast may be referred to as the " plastome ". == Genomes and genetic variation == Note that a genome does not capture the genetic diversity or the genetic polymorphism of a species. For example, the human genome sequence in principle could be determined from just half the information on the DNA of one cell from one individual. To learn what variations in genetic information underlie particular traits or diseases requires comparisons across individuals. This point explains the common usage of "genome" (which parallels a common usage of "gene") to refer not to the information in any particular DNA sequence, but to a whole family of sequences that share a biological context. Although this concept may seem counter intuitive, it is the same concept that says there is no particular shape that is the shape of a cheetah. Cheetahs vary, and so do the sequences of their genomes. Yet both the individual animals and their sequences share commonalities, so one can learn something about cheetahs and "cheetah-ness" from a single example of either. == Sequencing and mapping ==  The development of new technologies has dramatically decreased the difficulty and cost of sequencing, and the number of complete genome sequences is rising rapidly. Among many genome database sites, the one maintained by the US National Institutes of Health is inclusive. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=Genome&itool;=toolbar These new technologies open up the prospect of personal genome sequencing as an important diagnostic tool. A major step toward that goal was the May 2007 ''New York Times'' announcement that the full genome of DNA pioneer  was deciphered. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/science/31cnd-gene.html?em&ex;=1180843200&en;=19e1d55639350b73&ei;=5087%0A Whereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome. http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/whats_a_genome/Chp3_1.shtml http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/mapping.html == Comparison of different genome sizes ==  {| class="wikitable sortable"!Organism type!Organism!Genome size ( base pair s)!mass - in pg!!class="unsortable" |Note |- | Virus | Bacteriophage MS2 |align="right"|3,569 |align="right"|0.000002 | First sequenced RNA-genome |- | Virus | SV40 |align="right"|5,224 | | |- | Virus |align="right"|5,386 | |First sequenced DNA-genome |- | Virus | HIV |align="right"|9749 [http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/lecture/hiv9.htm VIROLOGY - HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS AND AIDS, STRUCTURE: The Genome AND PROTEINS of HIV] | | |- | Virus |align="right"|48,502 | |- | Virus | Mimivirus |align="right"|1,181,404 | |Largest known viral genome |- | Bacterium |'' Haemophilus influenzae '' |align="right"| 1,830,000 | |First genome of living organism, July 1995 |- | Bacterium |'' Carsonella ruddii '' |align="right"|159,662 | |Smallest non-viral genome.  |- | Bacterium |'' Buchnera aphidicola '' |align="right"|600,000 | |- | Bacterium |'' Wigglesworthia glossinidia '' |align="right"|700,000 | |- | Bacterium |'' Escherichia coli '' |align="right"|4,600,000 | | |- | Bacterium |'' Solibacter usitatus '' (strain Ellin 6076) |align="right"|9,970,000 | |Largest known Bacterial genome |- | Amoeboid |'' Polychaos dubium '' (''"Amoeba" dubia'') |align="right"|670,000,000,000 |align="right"|737 |Largest known genome.  |- | Plant |'' Arabidopsis thaliana '' |align="right"|157,000,000 | |First plant genome sequenced, December 2000. |- | Plant |'' Genlisea margaretae '' |align="right"|63,400,000 | |Smallest recorded flowering plant genome, 2006. |- | Plant |''Fritillaria assyrica'' |align="right"|130,000,000,000 | |- | Plant |'' Populus trichocarpa '' |align="right"|480,000,000 | |First tree genome, September 2006 |- | Moss |'' Physcomitrella patens '' |align="right"|480,000,000 | |First genome of a bryophyte, January 2008 Daniel Lang, Andreas D.

Since genomes and their organisms are very complex, one research strategy is to reduce the number of genes in a genome to the bare minimum and still have the organism in question survive. There is experimental work being done on minimal genomes for single cell organisms as well as minimal genomes for multicellular organisms (see Developmental biology ). The work is both '' in vivo '' and '' in silico ''.   == Genome evolution == Genomes are more than the sum of an organism's genes and have traits that may be measured and studied without reference to the details of any particular genes and their products. Researchers compare traits such as ''chromosome number'' ( karyotype ), genome size, gene order, codon usage bias, and GC-content to determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety of genomes that exist today (for recent overviews, see Brown 2002; Saccone and Pesole 2003; Benfey and Protopapas 2004; Gibson and Muse 2004; Reese 2004; Gregory 2005). Duplications play a major role in shaping the genome. Duplications may range from extension of short tandem repeats, to duplication of a cluster of genes, and all the way to duplications of entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty. Horizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related. Horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbe s. Also, eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondria l genomes to their nuclear chromosomes. ==See also== * Full Genome Sequencing * Gene * Gene family * Genome Comparison * Human genome * Human microbiome project * List of omics topics in biology * List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes * List of sequenced bacterial genomes * List of sequenced archeal genomes * List of sequenced plastomes * Minimal Genome Project * Mitochondrial genome * Molecular systematics * Molecular evolution * Multigenomic organism * Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium * National Human Genome Research Institute  ==References==  ==Further reading== *  *  *  *  *  *  == External links == * [http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/02_01/Sizing_genomes.shtml Some comparative genome sizes] * [http://www.dnai.org/ DNA Interactive: The History of DNA Science] * [http://www.dnaftb.org/ DNA From The Beginning] * [http://www.genome.gov/10001772 All About The Human Genome Project from Genome.gov] * [http://www.genomesize.com/ Animal genome size database] * [http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/cval/homepage.html Plant genome size database] * [http://www.genomesonline.org/ GOLD:Genomes OnLine Database] * [http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/ The Genome News Network] * [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=genomeprj NCBI Entrez Genome Project database] * [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/genetics_genome.html NCBI Genome Primer] * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4994088.stm BBC News - Final genome 'chapter' published] * [https://www.crops.org/genome/ The Plant Genome] * [http://img.jgi.doe.gov/ IMG] The Integrated Microbial Genomes system, for genome analysis by the DOE-JGI. * [http://camera.calit2.net/index.php/ CAMERA] Cyberinfrastructure for Metagenomics, data repository and bioinformatics tools for metagenomic research * [http://www.genecards.org/ GeneCards] an integrated database of human genes. * [http://genome.igib.res.in/ Genome@IGIB] Resources and News on the Zebrafish Genome Project @ IGIB. * [http://www.geknome.com GeKnome Technologies Next-Gen Sequencing Data Analysis] Next-Gen Sequencing Data Analysis for Illumina and 454 Service from GeKnome Technologies. *[http://ascb.org/ibioseminars/brenner/brenner1.cfm What Genomes Can Tell Us About the Past] - lecture by Sydney Brenner *[http://www.imame.org/form/genome--mid80-frz.htm Genome metaphor, reflecting from formal-net hierarchies, and software binaries].
