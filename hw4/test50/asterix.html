    The series follows the exploits of a village of ancient Gaul s as they resist Roman occupation. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character, Asterix, along with his friend Obelix have various adventures. In many cases, this leads them to travel to various countries around the world, though other books are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village. The Asterix series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most Europe an countries. Asterix is less well known in the United States and Japan.  ==History== Prior to creating the Asterix series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series '' Oumpah-pah '', which was published in the ''Tintin'' magazine. In 1961 the first book was put together entitled '' Asterix the Gaul ''. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. The Complete Guide To Asterix, Peter Kessler, Chaper I, page 16 Uderzo's first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dull companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born. The Complete Guide To Asterix, Peter Kessler "   Anne Goscinny also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series. and sold her rights at the same time. A few months later, Uderzo appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series.  == List of titles ==  Numbers 1 - 24, 32 and 34 are by both Goscinny and Uderzo.

'''''''''' (2009)  '' Asterix Conquers Rome '' is a comic book adaptation of the animated film '' The Twelve Tasks of Asterix ''. It was released in 1976, making it technically the 23rd ''Asterix'' volume to be published. But it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be canonical to the series. The only English translation ever to be published was in the ''Asterix Annual 1980''. ==Synopsis and characters==  The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village in Armorica, a province of Gaul (modern France ), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Empire, however the little Armorican village has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix. The main protagonist, and hero of the village, is Asterix, who is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village, because of his shrewdness. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat unintelligent friend Obelix, who has permanent superhuman strength, as he fell into the cauldron of the potion as a baby. Obelix is usually accompanied by Dogmatix, his little dog. Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village), go on various adventures both within the village, and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul ( Lutetia, Corsica etc), neighbouring nations ( Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc), and far away lands ( North America, Middle East, India etc). The series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books, for instance the use of extraterrestrials in '' Asterix and the Falling Sky '' and the city of Atlantis in '' Asterix and Obelix All at Sea ''. ==Humour==  The humour encountered in the ''Asterix'' comics is typically French, often centering on puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek  stereotype s of contemporary European nations and French regions. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: in the Italian translation, the Roman legionnaires are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous "''Ils sont fou ces romains''" is translated as "Sono pazzi questi romani", alluding to the roman abbreviation '' SPQR ''. The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual. In spite of (or perhaps because of) this stereotyping and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French chauvinism, it has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world. ==Translations== The 34 books or albums (one of which is a compendium of short stories) in the series have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects. Besides the original French, most albums are available in Estonian, English, Czech, Dutch, German, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese (and Brazilian Portuguese ), Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian and Croatian. Beyond modern Europe, some albums have also been translated into languages as diverse as Esperanto, Indonesian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Latin, Romansch, Vietnamese (mainly in the South pre-Communist April 30, 1975), and Ancient Greek. In France, in Finland, Poland and especially in Germany, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional language s and dialect s, such as Alsatian, Breton, Chtimi ( Picard ) and Corsican in France, Swabian and Low German in Germany, Kashubian  and Silesian  in Poland and Savo, Karelia, Rauma and Helsinki slang dialects in Finland. Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, Asterix the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese. In the Netherlands several volumes were translated into Frisian, a language related to Old English spoken in the province of Friesland. Also in the Netherlands two volumes were translated into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Hungarian -language books have been issued in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia. Although not a fully autonomic dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the Cretan Greek, Cypriot Greek and Pontic Greek dialects and in Ancient Greek.  In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala as Sura Pappa. ===English translation===  The translation of the books into English has been done by Derek Hockridge and Anthea Bell. == Adaptations == The series has been adapted into various media. === Films ===  Various motion picture s based upon the series have been made. * ''Two Romans in Gaul'', 1967, live-action, in which Asterix and Obelix appear in a cameo. * '' Asterix the Gaul '', 1967, animated, based on the book '' Asterix the Gaul ''. * ''Asterix and the Golden Sickle'', 1967, animated, based upon the comic book '' Asterix and the Golden Sickle '', incomplete and never released. * '' Asterix and Cleopatra '', 1968, animated, based on the book '' Asterix and Cleopatra ''. * '' The Twelve Tasks of Asterix '', 1976, animated, a unique story not based on an existing comic. * '' Asterix Versus Caesar '', 1985, animated, based on both '' Asterix the Legionary '' and '' Asterix the Gladiator ''. * '' Asterix in Britain '', 1986, animated, based upon the book '' Asterix in Britain ''. * '' Asterix and the Big Fight '', 1989, animated, based on both '' Asterix and the Big Fight '' and '' Asterix and the Soothsayer ''. * '' Asterix Conquers America '', 1994, animated, loosely based upon the comic '' Asterix and the Great Crossing ''. * '' Asterix and Obelix take on Caesar '', 1999, live-action, based primarily upon '' Asterix the Gaul '', '' Asterix and the Soothsayer '', '' Asterix and the Goths '', '' Asterix the Legionary '', and '' Asterix the Gladiator ''. * '''', 2002, live-action, based upon the comic book '' Asterix and Cleopatra ''. * '' Asterix and the Vikings '', 2006, animated, based upon the comic book '' Asterix and the Normans ''. * '' Asterix and Obelix at the Olympic Games '', 2008, live-action, based upon the comic book '' Asterix at the Olympic Games ''. === Games ===  Many gamebook s, boardgame s and video game s are based upon the Asterix series.
