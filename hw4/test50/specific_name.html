In zoological nomenclature, a '''specific name''' (sometimes, informally, also: '''specific epithet''') is the second part (second name) in the name of a species (a binomen ). The first part is the name of the genus. Note that in botanical nomenclature, "name" ''always'' refers to the whole name (of a species or otherwise), whereas in zoological nomenclature it can refer to either part of the binomen. :''Example:'' The scientific name for man is ''Homo sapiens'', which is the species name, consisting of two names: ''Homo'' is the " generic name " (the name of the genus) and ''sapiens'' the "specific name". Grammatically, a binomen (and a trinomen, also) must be treated as a Latin phrase, which gives some justification to the popular usage of the phrase "Latin name" for the more correct "scientific name". Grammatically (in Latin grammar), the specific name can be: * A noun in apposition with the genus: '' Panthera leo ''. The words do not necessarily agree in gender. This is very often a vernacular name, or the name (specific or generic) of a similar organism. * A noun in the genitive. ** This is common in parasites: '' Xenos vesparum '' ("of the wasps"). ** Names of people and places are used in the genitive: '' Latimeria chalumnae '' (of "Chalumna"). * An adjective, agreeing in case and gender with the genus: '' Felis silvestris '' ("the forest cat")
