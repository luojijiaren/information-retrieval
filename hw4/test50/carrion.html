 '''Carrion''' (from the Latin ''caro'', meaning meat) refers to the carcass of a dead animal. Carrion is an important food source for large carnivore s and omnivore s in most ecosystem s. Examples of carrion-eaters, or scavengers, include Hyena s, Vulture s, Virginia Opossum, Tasmanian Devil s, Black Bear s, Komodo Dragon s, Bald Eagle s, Raccoons, flying squirrels, and Blue-tongued lizard s. Many invertebrates, such as carrion beetle s (family ''Silphidae''), as well as maggot s of calliphorid flies and sarcophagid flies also eat carrion and play an important role in recycling animal remains. Carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal's death, and it will increasingly attract insects and breed bacteria. Not long after the animal has died, its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of cadaverine and putrescine. Some plant s and fungi smell like decomposing carrion and attract insect s that aid in reproduction. Plants that exhibit this behavior are known as carrion flower s. Stinkhorn  mushroom s are examples of fungi with this characteristic. The word carrion is often used in Danish mythology to describe animals that have been sacrificed and animals that have been killed due to the gods' fury. Sometimes carrion is used to describe an infected carcass that is diseased and shouldn't be touched. An example of carrion in literature is in William Shakespeare's play '' Julius Caesar '' with its line "this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men, groaning for burial" (III.i), in which the word carrion implies that the bodies are rotting and infected with disease and bacteria. Another example can be found in Daniel Defoe's '' Robinson Crusoe '' when the title character kills an unknown bird for food but finds "its flesh was Carrion, and fit for nothing."
